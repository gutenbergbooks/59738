    <p>Today a number of the Dutch spellings for place names, people’s names and
    specific words have changed but the colloquial spellings of
    the era have been retained, however where the name has been spelt two or more
    different ways, the spellings have been altered to the most prolific usage.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER XV Utrecht and ’S Hertogenbosch. This chapter is the only one with
    the word Chapter before it, and this has been retained.</p>

    <p>The spelling of the word <i>æsophagus</i> on p. 30, appears to be acceptable in
    the late 1800’s, early 1900’s, so this spelling has been retained.</p>

   <p>Other changes made are noted at the <a href="#end_note" title="Go to the End Note">end of the book.</a></p>

    <h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>


    <p>To put before the prospective visitor the many
    delights and few disadvantages of a territory with
    which he may be already more or less familiar; to
    help him to form a comprehensive idea of the most
    of Holland within a reasonably short space of travel
    time; to refocus the lens, to readjust the vernier of
    his memory, providing he has already been there,
    so that he may take a truer reading of the country
    upon a second visit; to recant the praises of a people
    whose very existence has been and ever will be one
    perpetual, indefatigable struggle against the most
    ubiquitous of all of man’s enemies&mdash;an element of
    the universe; to give a brief synopsis of what a vast
    amount there is to see and learn in a country so
    rich in accomplishments, so poor in area&mdash;these constitute
    the chief end of this book of travel through
    the Netherlands. If it fails in its mission it is by
    no means the fault of the Netherlands nor of whatever
    of interest is contained therein.</p>

    <p>If the text and illustrations inclosed between these
    covers cause but a single reader to live again a
    summer’s trip through Holland or prompt him to
    go there, there will be at least the satisfaction that
    the work has not been in vain.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

    appreciation to the editors of <cite>Travel</cite>, New York
    City, for permission to reprint as a part of the text
    of this book, together with the photographs pertaining
    to the different subjects, certain special

    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Take</span>, if you will, the state of Delaware, something
    less than half of Maryland and the lower
    end of New Jersey; turn them upside down;
    drive Delaware and Jersey and the most of Maryland
    below the level of the sea; let the waters of the
    Atlantic and the Chesapeake Bay seep in over the
    low-level territory; dike up the edges at the weak
    and exposed parts along the coast; pump the country
    dry, and keep it pumped dry, as far as possible&mdash;then,
    with a little less regularity of contour, you
    will have almost a geographical counterpart of Holland,
    both as to acreage and topography, although
    of but one fifth its total population. The Chesapeake
    Bay would equal the Zuyder Zee; Baltimore,
    if shifted to the other side of the Bay, might be
    substituted for Amsterdam; Wilmington on the
    Delaware would displace Rotterdam on the Maas;
    Hagerstown would fit the position of Arnhem; and,
    with the aid of a little elasticity of the imagination,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>Cape May might be mistaken for the Hook of
    Holland.</p>

    <p>Such, in brief, are the physical dimensions of, perhaps,
    the most unique, the most remunerative travel
    territory, acre for acre, in Europe.</p>

    <p>Holland, like ancient Gaul, is divided; but into
    two parts instead of three. If we draw an imaginary
    line north and south bisecting the Zuyder Zee, the
    country on the west side of this line may be designated
    as the more be-traveled, therefore the more
    familiar part. Hundreds of thousands of tourists,
    singly, in groups, in “personally conducted” parties,
    annually make use of it as a playground. Its unusual
    below-sea-level scenery, its historical buildings,
    its marvelous waterways, its sandy bathing beaches,
    the life in its cities, the poetic costuming of its rural
    inhabitants, its treasures and masterpieces of art&mdash;all
    combine to fulfill every condition required by the
    average sight-seer. In no other section of Europe
    are the distances between places of interest so short;
    in no other section are the modes and conveniences
    of reaching these places so varied. If the traveler
    relies solely upon the railways to carry him from one
    point to another, he may be compelled to wait two
    hours in order to ride ten minutes. A happy combination
    of the steam tram lines, the railways, and
    the canal packets, will enable him not only to get
    about without loss of time, but to penetrate curious,
    out-of-the-way parts of the country which one or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>the other of the different methods of transportation
    may overlook.</p>

    <p>The surface of the territory to the eastward of the
    imaginary longitude is barely scratched by the
    searcher of the picturesque and historical. Many
    of its towns are as interesting as any of those in
    the west, but, as a general rule, their peoples have
    been more easily influenced by German and Belgian
    methods, and, therefore, their characteristics differ
    greatly from those of the natives of North and
    South Holland and Zeeland, for example. What
    evidences of their history and art these towns still
    possess they have in a great measure failed to appreciate
    themselves, and it is this lack of self-confidence,
    translated into a complete failure so far to advertise
    their own scenic and historical virtues, that has bred
    the comparative aloofness with respect to them in
    the manner of the tourist through Holland. Probably
    the majority of travelers go to the Netherlands,
    not for art, nor for scenery, nor even for history,
    but for windmills and wooden shoes (to epitomize the
    characteristics of the country and its peoples), and
    for that reason their wanderings are bound to be
    confined, for the most part, to the exiguous territory
    bordered by the North Sea on the west and the
    Zuyder Zee on the east.</p>

    <p>The omnipresent story of Holland is the story of
    its fight against the waters. Its other conquests pale
    before it. Its eighty years’ revolution against the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>Spaniards cannot compare with it. Water is Holland’s
    perpetual and merciless enemy; so much so
    that if all the dikes that protect her from the waters
    of the ocean burst to-night, to-morrow there would
    be but a third of the country left. How she has
    conquered would fill a book in itself. Since the
    Frisian monks first commenced to dike in the country,
    successive inundations have blotted out the lives of
    more of her people than all her conquests at arms
    put together. But still the Dutch fought on, resolutely,
    unflinchingly, persistently, until they dredged
    what land they needed from the bottom of the sea
    and grew grass and flowers and vegetables where
    kelp and cockle-shells thrived before. After hundreds
    of years of dredging and diking, by 1833 Holland
    had attained an acreage of 8,768 square miles.
    By 1877 she had added another four thousand.</p>

    <p>Characteristic of the Dutch perseverance to conquer
    the menacing waters is a part of the report of
    the commission appointed to superintend the reclamation
    of the Haarlemermeer, an inland sea that
    once lapped the very gates of Amsterdam herself
    and upon which a fleet of seventy vessels once gave
    battle. “We have driven forever from the bosom
    of our country a most dangerous enemy,” said the
    commission, after its task had been completed; “we
    have at the same time augmented the means for defending
    our capital in time of war. We have conquered
    a province in combat without tears and without
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>blood, where science and genius took the place
    of generals, and where workmen were the worthy
    soldiers.”</p>

    <p>Previous to 1836 the Dutch had tolerated the
    Haarlemermeer. In November of that year a violent
    west wind lashed its waters into a fury and
    poured them into the streets of Amsterdam. On
    Christmas day there came an east wind that drove
    the waters from Amsterdam over into the streets of
    Leyden. This was too much. This was the straw
    that broke the camel’s back. This was what exhausted
    even the patience of the Dutch, and they
    picked up the gauntlet. They contrived a plan of
    methodical, systematic attack. They diked in the
    Lake with a high earthen cofferdam, installed a
    series of powerful pumps that sucked a thousand
    cubic feet of water at a single stroke of the piston,
    and they drew 800,000,000 tons of lake water up
    into the surrounding canals to be carried off to the
    sea with much the same complacency that you would
    imbibe a glass of soda through a straw. It took
    more than four years to complete the process. When
    it was finally finished the Dutch struck a medal in
    commemoration which bore in Latin the following
    matter-of-fact inscription: “Haarlem Lake, after
    having for centuries assailed the surrounding fields
    to enlarge itself by their destruction, conquered at
    last by the force of machinery, has returned to Holland
    its 44,280 acres of invaded land.” The significance
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>of the Dutch <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bon mot</i>, “God made the sea;
    we made the shore,” will never be more apparent
    than when you look out from the car window across
    the Zuidplaspolder near Rotterdam, with a minus
    altitude of more than thirty feet below the level
    of the ocean at mean tide.</p>

    <p>Holland being, as a whole, the lowest country in
    the world, is protected at the danger zones by the
    great dikes upon which almost the entire kingdom
    depends for its safety from disastrous inundation,
    and which require the annual cost of maintenance
    of approximately $12,000,000 and the undivided
    attention of a whole department of engineers. The
    mileage of the canals which intersect the country in
    every direction is greater than the mileage of the
    railroads. First and all the time, these canals, except
    those constructed for special purposes, serve
    for conducting the superfluous water from the cultivated
    areas. Second, they are highways for traffic.
    Travel on them is cheaper than on the steam tram
    lines, which is cheaper, in turn, than on the railways,
    for many of the latter are owned and operated by
    private companies, as in England. Even some of
    the lines built by the State are leased to a private
    concern. But unlike those of England, there can
    be little doubt that an investment in their stocks
    is a paying one, because railway building and railway
    up-keep in Holland are comparative sinecures.
    Grades are unknown, curves are scarce as the proverbial
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>hen’s teeth, except in the approaches to a
    city, and I failed to find a tunnel in the whole
    country.</p>

    <p>But touring in Holland is not so cheap as it is
    either in Germany or France. The unit basis of
    Dutch coinage is the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gulden</i>, of value equal to
    slightly more than two <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">francs</i> and just less than two
    <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marks</i>. There is even an oft repeated but exaggerated
    saying that a <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gulden</i> in Holland will only
    go as far as a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mark</i> in Germany. One of the reasons
    for the expensiveness of travel through the Netherlands
    is that to stop at any but the so-called first-class
    hostelries is a rather precarious business. In
    spite of all the Dutchman’s reputation for cleanliness,
    the less expensive hotels, unlike their ilk in Germany
    or Switzerland, are often anything but scrupulous
    in this matter and sometimes shockingly unsanitary.</p>

    <p>The system of Dutch municipal government is
    almost identical with that of Germany, the Burgomaster,
    or Mayor, being appointed by the crown
    instead of being elected by the community, so that
    a man may follow the profession of burgomastering
    as he would that of engineering. It is, withal, a
    system that might well supplant that in vogue in
    American cities, and if the experimental stages of
    municipal government by commission&mdash;lately tentatively
    adopted in some few cases as an expedient
    to do away with political bartering for executive
    positions&mdash;if this form of government proves its
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>worth, the professional mayor may yet become with
    us a reality.</p>

    <p>School attendance for children is compulsory in
    the Netherlands, but not free. The equivalent of
    eight American cents is the charge imposed by the
    State for one week’s tuition for one child in the
    primary grades, with stipulated increments added
    to the fee as the pupil advances. All schools are
    under the supervision of the State, and if a family
    is found too poor to pay the school taxes on its
    children, the fees are remitted. The trade school,
    however, of late inauguration, has revolutionized the
    old-time classical education to a great degree.</p>

    <p>Until the child attains the age of thirty years he
    or she is subservient to parental authority and must
    even obtain, up until that age, parental permission
    to marry&mdash;and the matter of marriage in Holland
    is by no means the least interesting of the customs
    of the country. Courtship is a protracted affair
    and follows the engagement indefinitely. Two weeks
    prior to the date of the wedding the legal declaration
    of the betrothal takes place, consisting of the
    “signing on” of both parties involved. The bride,
    with apt acknowledgment that an ounce of prevention
    is worth a pound of cure, at once proceeds to
    render herself immune from the usual deluge of cut
    glass and pie knives by compiling a list of acceptable
    wedding presents for the consultation of her relatives
    and friends, so that they may select such gifts
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>as are suited both to her needs and their pocketbooks.</p>

    <p>Of the civil marriage ceremonies there are three
    classes, not at all determined by the social positions
    of the contracting parties, but by the time required
    to tie the knot and the corresponding fee imposed.
    A first-class marriage may be performed on any day
    of the week, but the second and third-class marriages
    are conducted upon certain days, the different members
    of the City Council officiating by turns. Each
    of the second-class ceremonies is performed separately
    and the ritual repeated for each couple. A
    number of third-class marriages, however, may be
    conducted at one and the same time, and practically
    at club rates. The ceremony in this case is not altogether
    an impressive one but it serves its purpose
    at a cheaper price and is more quickly over with.
    The methods of procedure are somewhat as follows:</p>

    <p>Brides and bridegrooms to be, friends, relatives,
    and witnesses are ushered into a large room in the
    city hall. The member of Council in charge takes
    his position upon the dais, and the clerk calls the
    names of the contracting parties. They arise to
    acknowledge their identities, which are duly vouched
    for by the various witnesses in each case. The
    officer then proceeds to expatiate upon the duties
    of man and wife and upon the holy bonds of matrimony,
    directing his awesome remarks to the standing
    couples. In closing, he puts forth the question
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>as to whether each, in spite of all he has said, will
    take the other for better or for worse, abide by
    the laws, and love and cherish each other until death
    doth part, so help them. A loud and enthusiastic
    chorus in the affirmative is followed by a banging
    of the table right soundly with the official gavel,
    and the whole company is forthwith pronounced man
    and wife. Of course it is assumed by the conspirators
    which maiden the functionary has pronounced
    the wife of which young man; at all events, there is
    nothing on record about the wrong husband decamping
    with the wrong wife. Order comes out of
    apparent chaos and, as the story books read, they
    all live happily ever after.</p>

    <p>The civil ceremony is all that is required by law,
    but, possibly to moisten the already well executed
    knot in the tie that binds, many couples later undergo
    the religious ceremony in the church. The familiar
    wedding ring figures in neither the religious nor the
    civil ceremony. Each member of an engaged couple
    presents the other with a plain gold ring at the
    time of “plighting their troth,” as we observe in
    the novels, which is worn upon the third finger of
    the left hand until after the marriage, when it becomes
    a wedding ring and is transferred to the right
    hand.</p>

    <p>Until the advent of the little Princess Juliana
    Holland realized her danger of being ultimately absorbed
    by Germany. A German Prince had married
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>the sovereign of the Dutch nation, and German
    journals were not reticent in suggesting that, in
    the event of Queen Wilhelmina leaving no direct
    issue, the succession should revert to the family of
    the Prince Consort. Moreover, Germany had ever
    been jealous of Holland’s possession of the mouth
    of the greatest of German rivers&mdash;the Rhine, of
    which she sought the control from its source to the
    sea. Germany also had an eye upon Holland’s possessions
    for her own colonization&mdash;possessions that
    give this little country second place among the colonial
    powers of the world and which, in the Far East
    alone, aggregate in acreage fourteen times her own
    area. But the birth of Juliana precluded all immediate
    possibility of German usurpation, and the
    Hollanders didn’t convalesce from the effects of the
    joyous news for a whole week.</p>

    <p>The Dutch are an intensely patriotic people and
    have made heroic sacrifices to maintain the independence
    now assured them by the powers of the
    world&mdash;and the birth of Juliana. They are phlegmatic
    rather than impetuous; stoical rather than
    demonstrative; impassive rather than excitable. By
    virtue of their country’s unique maritime position it
    has bred the naval heroes, navigators, discoverers,
    and engineers whose names will remain synonymous
    for indomitable pluck so long as there exists a history
    of unequal fighting. By reason of the wealth
    derived from the foreign trade that these men made
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>possible it has fostered conspicuous groups of artists
    and scholars and scientists who in their times were
    the leaders of their guilds.</p>

    <p>It is with keen appreciation of the characteristics
    of the Hollander which enable him to offer to the
    traveling world so delightful a handmade territory,
    that I turn to the pages of “<cite>The Traveler</cite>” by
    Oliver Goldsmith and quote a short summary of Holland
    from the pen of one who traveled and observed,
    and who, by his enviable powers of description,
    analysis, and condensation, could epitomize a volume
    of significance in a single word of syncope.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> must be because the province of Zeeland seems
    too fearfully close to be interesting that the
    average traveler through Holland, if he enter
    by Flushing&mdash;one of the little country’s two principal
    sea gates&mdash;hurries from deck to dock like a
    somnambulist, and fights for his compartment in
    the four-something <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> train, bound for Amsterdam
    or The Hague. Perhaps, after being wakened most
    unsympathetically, if not rudely, at three-thirty in
    the morning, he feels disagreeable enough to take the
    first train out, no matter whence it cometh nor
    whither it goeth. But in so doing the aforementioned
    average sight-seer will make his first mistake&mdash;and
    a grave one&mdash;with regard to Holland. Part
    of the best of the country, scenically and historically,
    is just at the other end of the gangplank.</p>

    <p>This business of the arrival at Flushing of the
    night boat from Folkestone at the unheavenly hour
    of four in the morning, ought in itself be sufficient
    excuse to go first thing to the bedroom steward the

    at any rate; so, to arise at six will just give you time
    to array yourself in the proper regalia, indulge in
    a hurried breakfast of ham and eggs on board (at
    a shilling an egg), and climb into the seven-seven
    train for that capital of quaintness, not to mention
    the province of Zeeland&mdash;Middelburg. The four-something
    train ignores Middelburg with a passing
    snort.</p>

    <p>And a word here to the wise is sufficient: don’t
    settle yourself for an all day train ride. Don’t even
    exert yourself to the extent of hoisting your grip
    to the baggage rack. If the compartment be
    crowded&mdash;which it never is, going to Middelburg&mdash;you
    might hold your suit case on your lap the entire
    journey without fatigue or even <i>ennui</i>. Middelburg
    is four miles from Flushing. If the engineer doesn’t
    slow down to blow the whistle it will take just eleven
    minutes to cover the distance.</p>

    <p>I have anticipated the fact that the sum total
    of your baggage will consist of a suit case, because
    personally conducting a trunk through Holland
    would be just as incongruous as saddling a Shetland
    pony with an elephant howdah.</p>

    <p>There are two methods of seeing the Island of
    Walcheren, equally fascinating, and the visitor can
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>avail himself of both in one and the same day. The
    first is by climbing the two hundred and seventy-odd
    steps to the top of “Long John” in Middelburg, and
    the second by a drive around the Island, covering,
    perhaps, thirty miles, and touching the three principal
    places of interest: Veere, Domburg, and Westkapelle.
    To state here that the Island of Walcheren
    is not an island might seem a bit ambiguous, but it
    is true, nevertheless, and may be explained away as
    follows:</p>

    <p>Long before our time, perhaps in the distant
    Paleozoic age, Walcheren was nothing more than
    shallow water. Along came the Dutch&mdash;who have a
    happy faculty of making their own geography as
    they need it&mdash;and, seeing prospects in its development,
    built a sort of cofferdam around it, pumped
    the place dry, and made it into an island. It made
    a fairly good island, and in later years they grafted
    it on to the parent land by a long embankment across
    an arm of the Scheldt, and made it into a peninsula.
    A peninsula it still remains, but its future is all a
    matter of conjecture.</p>

    <p>“Long John,” or <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Lang Jan</i>, if the sobriquet be
    translated into Dutch, is practically the Washington
    Monument of Walcheren. It is the two-hundred-and-eighty-foot
    tower of the Nieuwe Kerk in Middelburg,
    capped with a climax of forty-one bells that
    chime a quaint fragment of some familiar popular
    melody every seven-and-a-half minutes. On the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>hour Long John literally vibrates from foundation
    to weather vane in a frenzied endeavor to pour forth
    <i>in toto</i> the accumulation of more or less music administered
    in small doses during the previous sixty
    minutes.</p>

    <p>It is up the middle of Long John you must climb
    in a spiral to obtain a first impression of Walcheren.
    It is a tedious task, and by the time you are halfway
    up you are blessing the memory of the man who
    twined the now much worn hand rope along the steep
    staircase. You may even be about to give up in disgust,
    when, of a sudden, you stumble in upon the
    lofty hermitage of old Hendrick Landman, the keeper
    of the bells.</p>

    <p>Hendrick sits serenely in his armchair in an extremely
    well ventilated room at the top of the spiral
    and lets people pay a small fee for the privilege of
    climbing up to have him point out the view and
    exhibit his mechanical masterpiece a few ladder
    lengths higher up. Hendrick’s view alone is doubly
    worth the climb, and, after reimbursing him to the
    equivalent extent of about eight cents in American
    coinage, you will also have to admit that he can
    certainly keep bells. I know nothing of whatever
    else Hendrick can or cannot do, but he can certainly
    keep bells; and after all, a man can hope for nothing
    more than to achieve success in his chosen calling.
    Hendrick also takes just pride in the condition of
    the Gargantuan Swiss music box that is responsible
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>for the two or three bars every seven-and-a-half
    minutes. He oils it and he winds it assiduously
    twice every day in the year.</p>

    <p>Taken by and large, Hendrick is an unimpeachable
    bell keeper.</p>

    <p>After having been duly and visibly impressed with
    the manner in which Hendrick keeps his bells and his
    garrulous music box, it might be well to tarry with
    him for a few moments at the foot of the ladder
    and attempt a squint or two through the old gentleman’s
    telescope, which, from the appearance of it,
    might be a lineal descendant of the first ones ever
    put together by Zacharias Jansen, all of three hundred
    years ago and not more than a few feet from
    the base of the tower you stand upon.</p>

    <p>Jansen, the inventor of the telescope and the
    microscope, and Father Jacob Cats, the humorist-poet-philosopher,
    were contemporaries in Middelburg
    for a time, and the town claims them as its two most
    illustrious sons. The children of Jansen’s genius
    may still be viewed in the little Museum of the
    Zeeuwsch Genootschap der Watenschappen (don’t
    ask me to pronounce the name of that society; it is
    task enough to spell it correctly) in the Wagenaarstraat
    of Zeeland’s capital; Father Cats will live in
    Holland in book form until the end of all things.</p>

    <p>If the atmosphere be clear, you would think that
    a strong wind from the north could topple Long
    John, including bells, music box, Hendrick Landman
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>and his telescope, and all, upon the bathing beach
    of Flushing itself&mdash;the place seems so close below
    you. Flushing of to-day is nothing more than a
    pseudo bathing resort, much patronized by easily
    pleased Germans, and a handy terminus for ’cross-channel
    passenger boats. But the name of Flushing
    also means much in the history of Holland.</p>

    <p>Here was born in 1607 that popular idol of the
    Dutch, Admiral de Ruyter, the son of a rope maker,
    although his mother, whose name he assumed, happened
    to be of noble birth. De Ruyter flourished
    at a particularly favorable time in the middle of
    the seventeenth century, when the navigation acts
    passed by Cromwell placed unbearable restrictions
    on trade with Holland. The ensuing war with England
    called into play de Ruyter’s talents, and a large
    majority of the thirteen great naval battles fought
    within a period of sixteen months were won by the
    Dutch. It was not, however, until a later war with
    England that de Ruyter performed his principal and
    culminating achievement. In 1667, at the age of
    sixty, he mustered his fleet and forced a fairway up
    the Thames to the very gates of London herself,
    demolishing fortifications and shipping as he went,
    and plunging London into a panic.</p>

    <p>Flushing, too, was the scene of embarkation of the
    unhappy Charles <abbr title="5">V</abbr> in 1556, and of Philip <abbr title="2">II</abbr> three
    years later, neither of whom ever returned. As you
    look out upon the Scheldt from your coign of vantage
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>at the top of Long John you can almost picture
    the scene on the deck of the vessel when Philip denounced
    the Prince of Orange as having thwarted
    his plans, declaring the innocent William an ingrate,
    and doubtless a host of other names unfit for publication.</p>

    <p>It was Flushing that first hoisted the ensign of
    liberty against the Spaniard, Alva, and it was Flushing,
    during the Napoleonic wars of 1809, that the
    English fleet, with the ultimate capture of Antwerp
    at heart, bombarded so vigorously that the magnificent
    Town Hall, a couple of churches, and no less
    than two hundred private houses were razed to the
    ground.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_020.jpg" alt="" width="694" height="391" />
    <p class="center">Looking down over the roofs of Middelburg from the
    bell tower of Long John. From here one can see most of the Island of
    Walcheren</p>
    </div>

    <p>From Long John one can see plainly the towns
    on the north and west coasts of Walcheren, and often
    even the spires of Antwerp are visible, while directly
    below&mdash;a mass of red roofs punctured here and there
    with patches of trees&mdash;stretches Middelburg. To the
    left is the market place, bounded on the north by
    the handsome Town Hall begun in the sixteenth century,
    the embellishment of whose façade by twenty-five
    ancient statues of the counts and countesses of
    Holland helps it to hold its place as one of the
    finest and most interesting late-Gothic edifices in
    the Netherlands. The tower of the Town Hall has
    a chime, too, and each time after Long John so
    insistently proclaims the hour of the day or night&mdash;for
    Long John takes the credit of giving standard
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>time to Middelburg&mdash;it must get a bit on his nerves
    to have “Foolish Betsy” (<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gekke Betje</i>), up in the
    Town Hall tower, rattle off her cacophonous contradiction
    a minute or two earlier, or later, as the
    case may be.</p>

    <p>To the right is the peaceful square inclosed by
    the famous old Abbey of St. Nicholas, founded as
    early as 1106, and later, in the sixteenth century,
    the scene of a memorable meeting of the Knights
    of the Golden Fleece.</p>

    <p>Then, after a last good-by to Hendrick and his
    companionable telescope, you clatter down the tower
    steps, ignoring with consummate contempt the twining
    hand rope which, in the ascent, so forcibly appealed
    to your avoirdupois.</p>

    <p>The road from Middelburg to Veere, a distance
    of three or four miles, is brick-paved and lined with
    trees, as is the habit of most highways in Holland;
    and if it is your first experience thoughts pertaining
    to the thoroughness of the Dutch will doubtless be
    in order. It may have taken more time and it may
    have cost more money to lay brick roads, but then
    the expense and labor of repair are minimum. The
    building of roads is but one of the many tasks that
    the Hollander does not believe in doing over again
    in a year or two; so he lays them in brick&mdash;and the
    comfort of passengers in vehicles is of no consideration.
    There is a road from Monnikendam to Edam
    which might give a horse spavin to look upon. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>blame for the wearing out of the road, in this case,
    is placed upon the poor beast, and down the middle
    of it they have laid a brick-paved path, the sides
    being merely macadamized.</p>

    <p>The landscape of Walcheren seems set as if for
    a theatrical performance. There is a place for everything,
    and everything is in its place. Left, a tree-encircled,
    thatch roofed farmhouse, built as an addition
    to the barn in the back, so as to save a wall;
    right, a line of willows, all twins, that fringe a road
    along the top of a dike; up stage, a windmill of
    methodical movements, and, perhaps, a sailboat passing
    slowly along a narrow canal&mdash;too narrow and
    too high above the eye for the audience to obtain a
    glimpse of any water at all&mdash;giving the effect of a
    mirage; down stage, a black and white cow. Of
    course it will be a black and white cow, because,
    figuratively, you might count the red cows in Holland
    on your fingers. And such a scene is not typical
    of the Island of Walcheren alone, but of the
    Netherlands in general. Any other type of scenery
    might become wearisome, but possibly the brevity of
    the train ride or the substitution of a boat or
    steam tram trip between one point of interest and
    another has a lot to do with relieving the monotony.</p>

    <p>Of all Zeeland, the particular costume of that
    province can be observed to the best advantage on
    the island of Walcheren. A milkmaid of Middelburg,
    for example, is a joy to look upon. Her spotless
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>white cap bristles at the temples with <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">kurkenkrullen</i>
    like the antennæ of a prehistoric beetle. Her skirts
    are ankle-high and padded generously at the hips.
    If she be naturally rotund and the skirts need no
    padding, circumstantial evidence of the fact is sufficient
    to stamp her the belle of the community. The
    sleeves of her bodice are very short and very tight,
    pinching the arms above the elbows so that they
    might be mistaken for a pair of aggravated cases
    of inflammatory rheumatism. Of course the sun in
    all its glory strikes the backs of these arms, for she
    always walks with them akimbo, the better to balance
    the pails which dangle one from each end of a
    wooden yoke, enameled a vivid robin’s egg blue.
    But the redder the arms from the rays of the sun
    and the tighter the pinch of the sleeves, the flatter
    the chest and the broader the hips, the sooner will she
    cease to be a mere milkmaid through the medium of
    a simple marriage ceremony in the village <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">kerk</i>.</p>

    <p>The only discordant note in the otherwise harmonious
    landscape on the road to Veere may be said
    to be a flitting one. It assumes the distended shape
    of a buxom village maiden in the full provincial costume&mdash;padded
    skirts and all&mdash;astride a bicycle,
    spinning townward or homeward over the bricks.
    For the bicycle, be it known, is the natural&mdash;and
    it has therefore become the national&mdash;means of locomotion
    in Holland. Everybody rides bicycles; and
    since the only hills are the approaches to the dikes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>or across the humpbacked span of a canal drawbridge,
    their invention has been no less a boon to
    the populace at large than it has been a bane to
    the sight-seer. In The Hague, for example, they
    have become a veritable pest, and to be constantly
    dodging them in the streets keeps a person very
    much on the jump.</p>

    <p>By and by you will rattle into Veere. You can
    tell it is Veere by its church, for Veere’s church is
    something to remember. It is by far the biggest
    thing on the island of Walcheren. It is the first
    building of historical or architectural importance
    that you will pass on entering the town from Middelburg,
    and its immensity, so foreign to the Veere of
    to-day, may be able to convey to you some remote
    idea of what Veere used to be before the sea leaked
    in over the cofferdam and blotted out most of the
    place between suns.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_024.jpg" alt="" width="611" height="440" />
    <p class="center">This picturesque tower at Westkapelle belonged
    originally to a fifteenth-century church that was burned in 1831. It is
    now used as a lighthouse</p>
    </div>

    <p>Built in 1348, this church weathered even the
    terrible encroachment of the sea; but along came
    Napoleon in 1812. Napoleon, being accustomed to
    move, lock, stock and barrel, into the most sumptuous
    quarters of every town he visited, took a particular
    liking to Veere’s church and promptly made
    a barracks of it. There is no more complete method
    of demolishing the interior of a building than to turn
    it into a barracks, especially a Napoleonic barracks,
    and since the Little Corsican’s unwelcome visit to
    Veere the old church has remained ravaged, mildewed,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>and decayed. In a corner of the east end, however,
    the people of Veere still gather for spiritual worship.
    Twelve years ago they started to restore the
    church, but if the receipt of funds is not a little
    more prompt in the future they may some day have
    to restore the restorations.</p>

    <p>Several quaint old houses of the sixteenth century;
    an impressive tower at the mouth of the harbor,
    whose mate lies buried under the sea; and the Town
    Hall, containing an unimportant museum save for a
    few royal documents and a richly enameled goblet,
    presented to the town in 1551 by Maximilian of
    Burgundy, the first marquis of Veere&mdash;these and the
    church are the sole relics of Veere’s previous prosperity
    not claimed by the ocean.</p>

    <p>A rapid succession of long, shady, hedge-fringed
    avenues lead from Veere to Domburg, the curious
    little bathing resort on the northwest coast of the
    island. Approximately halfway, at West Hove,
    there stands a famous old castle, once the residence
    of the Abbots of Middelburg, which remains in such
    a perfect state of preservation&mdash;although modernized,
    of course, to a certain degree&mdash;that in the
    summer it is used as a sanatorium for the poor
    children of the Flushing and Middelburg districts.
    Just across the road an attractive modern building,
    more like a country home in design, does duty as a
    full-fledged hospital.</p>

    <p>The town of Domburg gives not the least evidence
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>of being situated on the seaside, as do the most of
    our Atlantic Coast resorts by their bleakness, but
    seems rather an inland village, thickly sprinkled with
    and all but completely surrounded by trees. At its
    back and just a few steps behind the sand dunes,
    lies the sea, while a stretch of well formed, sandy
    beach, which entices to Domburg each summer a
    goodly number of Dutch people and the few foreigners
    who know of its charms, slopes away beyond
    the dunes.</p>

    <p>For five miles farther, to Westkapelle, the road
    lies first behind the dunes and then behind the giant
    dike for which this, one of the most exposed and
    at the same time one of the lowest sections of Holland,
    is famous. Presently you find yourself bowling
    along on top of the dike, with the sea lapping restlessly
    at its thick, beveled-stone hide on the right,
    and the village of Westkapelle, nestling some feet
    below the water level even at low tide, yet secure
    behind the backbone of its protector, on the left.
    This dike, being of necessity one of the largest and
    strongest along the Dutch coast, receives the tenderest
    of care in the hands of the Government, for, in
    case of a break in it, the Island of Walcheren would
    be reduced to its former state of shallow sea water
    in less time than it would take to set the type of the
    “scare-head” in the newspapers to tell of the catastrophe.
    The laborers who are constantly employed
    at work upon it are supposed to be the direct descendants
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>of the Danish fishermen who dragged these
    waters with their nets far back in Norman times.</p>

    <p>Aside from its dike the most conspicuous object
    in the vicinity of Westkapelle is the lofty, square,
    Gothic tower, belonging originally to a fifteenth-century
    church burned down in 1831. This tower the
    Dutch have aptly turned into practical service by
    making a lighthouse of it. The powerful reflectors
    at its top have a radius of twenty-five miles or more
    and, even in the daytime, the tower is as much of a
    landmark along the west coast of the island as the
    church at Veere is along the north.</p>

    <p>Driving from Westkapelle back to Middelburg you
    scarcely pass out from the throes of one tollgate
    until you are enmeshed in those of another. You
    are assumed to be honest in Zeeland and expected
    to march right up to the door of the tollhouse, pass
    a cordial time of day with the character who keeps
    it, and pay your little five or six Dutch cents without
    even so much as giving vent to the time-honored conjecture
    that the farmers thereabouts must be too
    well off to work out their taxes on the roadway.</p>

    <p>Nor is it only the tollhouse keeper who has a
    pleasant word of greeting for you, but every native
    you pass, man, woman, or child, will have a nod and
    a smile and a cheery “Good evening”&mdash;although you
    may not recognize the verbiage. The sturdy truck
    farmer, with gold earrings and cropped hair, trudging
    homeward in the wake of his push-cart; the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>thickly padded maiden with her dangling milk pails;
    the tiny boys and girls, diminutive counterparts of
    their parents as regards a costume which wavers not
    with the change of fashion&mdash;all seem to think it their
    especial assignment to treat the tourist on Walcheren
    as a visitor and not an invader.</p>

    <span class="chap_name">From Middelburg to Dortrecht</span></h2>


    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">If</span> the American traveler expects to stop off along
    the line from Middelburg at a little place called
    Goes, he will undergo his first operation with the
    Dutch language. Should he fail to catch sight of
    the signboard that proclaims in print the name of
    the station, or to compare his watch with his timetable
    in order to ascertain in this manner the exact
    bearings of the point of stoppage, he will probably
    be carried on through, for it will not occur to him
    that he had planned to detrain when the tin-horn-girdled
    conductor rattles up and down the platform
    shouting, “Whose.” But “Whose” is the way Goes
    is pronounced&mdash;and this is simply introductory.</p>

    <p>Some there be who try to insist that we have nothing
    to brag about in the way of euphonic orthography,
    which is more or less of a cold fact. But then,
    we are used to it. The same may be said of the
    Dutch language, and it is to be hoped that the Dutch
    are used to <em>it</em>. They seem to get along with it
    passably well, at all events. But their ability to
    master the impossible does not alleviate our troubles
    in the least. Any nation that can spell “ice” y-s
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>and i-j-s with equal complacency, and gather the
    same meaning from both methods, deserves to be
    misunderstood.</p>

    <p>The Dutch letter <em>g</em>, to come back to Goes, strikes
    terror to the vocal organs of the most versatile
    linguist. It is treated with somewhat the same disrespect
    that the Spanish treat their <em>j</em>, only more so.
    The Dutch pronunciation of a word beginning with
    <em>g</em> is started somewhere in the anatomical vicinity of
    the diaphragm and allowed to percolate up through
    the æsophagus, gathering harshness and strength
    until it comes in violent contact with the larynx,
    whence it is finally ejaculated with about the same
    sound as a bad attack of hay fever. I quote a passage
    from a certain work on Holland, the author of
    which infers that if any person not of Dutch descent
    can repeat the sentence correctly as to sound and
    emphasis, to him the mastery of the remainder of
    the language will seem like child’s play. The sentence
    follows: “<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Grietje, gooi geen goeje groente in
    de gracht.</i>” The interlinear cribbing of it would be
    in English, “Gretchen, do not throw any good vegetables
    into the canal.”</p>

    <p>But since the Dutch have made so many brave
    attempts to discover a goodly portion of the east
    coast of the United States, there may be found in
    any geography of America a number of proper
    names, originally of Dutch origin, but now Anglicized
    to meet our requirements. They thought so
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>much of the beauties of the lower end of New York
    Bay that they promptly applied to it the term,
    “Beautiful Outlet,” or, in Dutch, <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Helle Gat</i>.
    “Hell Gate” must obviously be a deal less difficult,
    although scarcely more poetic. For the same reason
    does the Americanized Cape Henlopen supplant the
    correct name of the Friesland town of Hindeloopen
    from which its discoverer hailed. The name of a certain
    street in lower Manhattan must also be of Dutch
    derivation, for our word “Bowery” may be found
    as <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bouwerij</i>, which means a “peasant’s dwelling” in
    the vocabulary of the Netherlands. And these are
    but a few of the numerous words and syllables heard
    in America that may be attributed to Dutch influence.</p>

    <p>Hard by the town of Goes the tourist will obtain
    a comprehensive idea of what a real <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">polder</i> looks
    like, although it is scarcely distinguishable from the
    fact that all of the scenery along the route from
    Flushing east is typical, below-sea-level Dutch, lavishly
    cut by canals into triangles, trapezoids, and
    parallelograms.</p>

    <p>A <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">polder</i>, by way of explanation, is the reclaimed
    bed of a sheet of water; and since the greater part
    of Holland lies below the level of the sea, the most
    of it is <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">polder</i>. Land thus reclaimed is of extraordinary
    fertility by reason of the fact that the water
    under which it was once submerged, having been
    pumped into surrounding canals, is readily available
    for irrigation purposes in event of a dry season.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
    <p>The initial move in this really marvelous process
    of making land while you wait consists of building
    a dike around the prospective <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">polder</i> to fortify it
    against future inundations. Next, they literally kick
    the water out of the inclosed area by means of a
    peculiarly constructed water wheel, formerly driven
    by a windmill, but latterly&mdash;the Dutch having become
    inoculated with twentieth century impatience&mdash;by
    the adaptation of steam or gasoline power to the
    task. Often, however, the bed of the marsh or lake
    to be reclaimed lies too deep to admit of its water
    being at once kicked into the main canals to be
    carried off to the ocean. Such a condition of affairs
    will necessitate the lake being surrounded with a
    veritable series of dikes, each higher than the one
    before, like the amphitheater of a clinic (a slightly
    exaggerated simile), and each with a canal on its
    farther side from the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">polder</i>. The water is then
    pumped from a lower level to a higher one until,
    finally, it is forced to admit the utter uselessness of
    trying to compete with the Dutch. The <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">polder</i> near
    Goes, known as the Wilhelminapolder, is something
    like 4,000 acres in extent and was reclaimed from
    the sea the same year that Napoleon was undoing
    the history of ecclesiastical architecture in Veere.</p>

    <p><i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Polder</i> making is a specialty with the Dutch
    engineers, and the end of their ingenuity is not yet
    in sight. Even now they are making gigantic preparations
    to spend upwards of $80,000,000 in the reclamation
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>of the whole lower half of the Zuyder Zee,
    two thirds of which is to be constructed into a <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">polder</i>
    having an area of 1,400 square miles. The dike will
    stretch across the Zee from the village of Ewyksluis
    in North Holland to Piaam in Friesland, the cost of
    which alone is estimated at about $18,000,000.</p>

    <p>On any other day but Tuesday there can be no
    excuse for the traveler to take the least heed of the
    train conductor’s garglings and stop off at Goes; but
    the costumes of Zeeland, as seen at a Tuesday’s
    market, are well worth a break in the journey.</p>

    <p>A few miles beyond Goes the train crosses the Zuid-Beveland
    Canal, which intersects the long, straggling
    island of that name and of which Goes is the capital.
    The canal was cut through by the Dutch engineers
    in 1863–66 as a sort of apology to nature for their
    having deliberately closed up an arm of the Scheldt
    called the Kreekerak&mdash;a body of water that the
    Dutch never trusted since its contribution to the
    inundation of the east coast of Flemish Zeeland.
    Previous to 1532 that east coast was fertile farm
    land and populated by peace-loving peasants. But
    in that year the dike burst. Three thousand inhabitants
    are alleged to have perished, and the locality
    is still under water, it being known to-day as Verdronken
    Land, or “Drowned Land.”</p>

    <p>A little later your train will cross the Kreekerak
    on the embankment they built, and Bergen-op-Zoom
    is the next stop.</p>

    <p>They say Bergen-op-Zoom used to be one of the
    most flourishing towns in the Netherlands. Doubtless
    that is true. The only flourishing parts to be
    found about it now are its thousand and one rags
    flourished by its thousand and one housemaids scrubbing
    its thousand and one doorsteps. The latter are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>incessantly being cleaned and recleaned by the
    former in the hands of the intermediate; so much so,
    indeed, that it appears as if each maid were trying
    for a record. Bending double or down on their
    knees&mdash;in every conceivable attitude they attack their
    front doorsteps as many times a day as they think
    necessary, which is rather more than often. I
    have never read a consular report that speaks of
    Holland as a territory open for trade in mops. They
    may be on sale, but I have yet to see one in action.
    For one cause or another the Dutch seem to cling
    to the hand method of wringing the cloth over the
    bucket, then bending double and sloshing it from
    side to side across the pavement with a movement
    akin to that of a nervous captive elephant; but perhaps
    for the reason that this Dutch method is
    not and never can be thorough, do they deem it
    exigent to repeat the operation with such frequence.</p>

    <p>The lesson gleaned from all this is how the Dutch
    have beaten their lifelong enemy, water, at its own
    game, ousted it, and then turned round and made of
    it an humble and subjected medium for keeping the
    country clean.</p>

    <p>Most towns west of the Zuyder Zee are so notoriously
    clean that even walking over the pavements is
    not encouraged. For reasons of his own a householder
    will continue his property line out across his
    two or three feet of pavement with the help of a
    chain or iron railing, more or less decorative, so
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>that the pedestrian, when he comes to the barrier,
    must side-step into the street in order to pass it.</p>

    <p>There are four or five other features of Bergen-op-Zoom
    that I remember no less distinctly. One
    was the imposing old Gevangenpoort with its massive
    brick archway. It dates from the fifteenth century
    and constitutes one of the few remaining relics
    of the ancient town fortifications. Another was the
    accomplished female at the railway station, who
    served liquid refreshments to warm and weary travelers
    and, by way of diversion for the sake of
    accumulating a few extra absurd little ten cent pieces,
    handled the baggage of arriving and departing visitors
    to the town with the ease and strength of a full-blown
    <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dientsmann</i>. If there happened to be too
    many pieces of luggage to carry at once, she invariably
    remembered where someone had hidden a wheelbarrow
    conveniently near the station. This she
    would fetch, often without the knowledge or consent
    of its owner, load the luggage upon it, and march
    off with a dignified, “what-do-you-think-of-me”
    sort of an air.</p>

    <p>Another feature was the glaring heat of the place&mdash;the
    day of my visit being a rather humid one in
    July; and still another&mdash;the most important of all&mdash;was
    a quiet, shady nook on the low portico of a little
    café just back of the Groote Kerk, from which sheltered
    position I looked up more than once over the
    tops of the trees and admired the lofty steeple of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>the old house of worship through the bottom of a
    tall, slender glass.</p>

    <p>But a short ride from Bergen-op-Zoom brings you
    to Rosendaal, which, from the apparent activity
    about the station, might be by long odds the most
    important town in all Holland. It is the seat of
    the Dutch customhouse and therefore the junction
    of many railway lines, north, south, east, and west;
    or <i>vice versa</i>. All roads lead in the Netherlands,
    not to Rome, but to Rosendaal. To explore the town
    is scarcely worth the trouble, but the railway station
    itself deserves especial notice. If you enter Holland
    from the Belgian frontier it will be impossible not to
    notice it, for the train will stop long enough at
    Rosendaal for the customs officials to question each
    and every passenger personally about cigars, perfumery,
    and other dutiable articles. If you come
    from the east or the west it is eleven chances to one
    you will have to change cars at Rosendaal, in which
    latter predicament you will at least enjoy a stroll
    up and down the long station platform.</p>

    <p>This Rosendaal station struck me as being about
    the cleanest, shiniest place, for a railway station,
    at which I had ever changed cars. Not a speck of
    soot or dust was visible to the naked eye, and it is
    possible that one of old Zacharias Jansen’s microscopes
    wouldn’t be able to find any either, although a
    certain few, larger and more grotesque than their
    fellows, might be brought to notice under the lens
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>of an instrument of later model. Every doorway
    was guarded by a pair of little boxwood or bay tree
    sentries, and flowers filled the boxes under the windows.
    The leather tables and chairs in the waiting-rooms
    and restaurant all but suggested a Spanish
    Renaissance influence, and their great brass-topped
    tacks glittered as if they had never known what it
    was to be tainted with stain or smirch&mdash;and this in
    a railway station.</p>

    <p>But then, a Dutch locomotive is not nearly so
    offensive, I might say, as one of the American breed;
    and if the proper legislation is forthcoming we shall
    be sending experts to Holland soon to take notes
    on how they do it. All railway locomotives in Holland
    are under the supervision of an arm of the
    government service, and although the most of them
    bear the shop-plate of Glasgow or Manchester, they
    must be equipped with an apparatus, not only for
    consuming the smoke but for the prevention of the
    emission of sparks and other combustible matter.
    Descriptions and drawings showing the details and
    workings of these contrivances must be submitted to
    the Supervising Board of Railways before each new
    type of locomotive is purchased. Upon its delivery
    every newly purchased locomotive must undergo a
    thorough test and be approved by the inspector of
    the Board before it may be placed in service.</p>

    <p>The same regulations apply to stationary engines
    burning bituminous coal, which would otherwise emit
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>great clouds of black smoke, gases, and soot. Restrictions,
    in some localities, are even placed upon
    the particular kind of fuel locomotives may burn.
    The province of Zuid-Holland, for example, has
    issued the eikon that only coke may be used upon the
    locomotives that traverse its railway lines.</p>

    <p>A few miles before you come to Dortrecht the
    railway crosses a long bridge that spans an arm of
    the North Sea known as the Hollandsch Diep. The
    actual breadth of the Diep is a mile and five-eighths,
    but its projecting stone piers cut the length of the
    bridge down to slightly less than a mile. This, the
    longest bridge in Holland, was completed in November,
    1871, after being more than three years in the
    building, and its fourteen arches, with a span of 110
    yards each, rest upon stone buttresses, the foundations
    of some of which are sunk fifty or sixty feet
    below low water mark. From the center of the structure
    you may look out over the Hollandsch Diep
    on the left and, on the right, the eastern end of the
    Biesbosch, or “reed forest”&mdash;a great, watery district
    more than forty square miles in area and lately
    reclaimed. It was formed in 1421, at the same time
    and under the same conditions as the Hollandsch
    Diep, by a terrific overflow of the sea that blotted
    out seventy-two towns and villages and the lives of
    100,000 people.</p>

    <p>Dortrecht, called Dordt by the Dutch, is practically
    a survivor of that calamity. The town was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>founded away back in 1008 and, four hundred years
    later, made an island by the obstreperous Merwede&mdash;the
    name given to a short part of the river formed
    by the confluence of the Maas and the Waal, which,
    beyond Dortrecht, is called De Noord and, by the
    time it approaches Rotterdam, known as the Maas
    again.</p>

    <p>By reason of a special privilege called The Staple&mdash;pure
    and simple “graft,” plainly speaking&mdash;Dortrecht
    in the Middle Ages was the most prosperous
    town in Holland, for the workings of The Staple
    were far-reaching and marvelous. The Staple allowed
    Dortrecht, by royal warrant, be it remembered,
    to act in the capacity of a kind of clearing house
    for all goods, whether wines, grains, metals, or fabrics,
    that entered the domains of Holland by way
    of the Rhine. Now the territory punctured by these
    hundred and one apparently different and distinct
    rivers that so muddle the geography of the southern
    part of Holland for the tourist, is nothing more
    nor less than the wide-spreading estuary of the one
    river, Rhine. As every cargo that came down the
    river had necessarily to be unloaded at Dortrecht,
    municipal and private money chests burst their stout
    iron hoops in their efforts to contain the duties and
    taxes imposed. And in this kind of business buccaneering
    the place reveled for centuries, until Rotterdam,
    overcome with jealousy in 1618, stopped the
    procedure at the point of the bayonet.</p>

    <p>If Wilmington, Delaware, although just twice as
    large in point of population, could boast of a windmill
    or two and a few odoriferous canals, bordered
    with numerous sixteenth century façades that slanted
    out over them as if in imminent danger of toppling
    into them; and if she had a narrow street of rather
    serpentine proclivities, like the Wynstraat, down
    which the rolling stock of the local traction company,
    in the shape and vintage of an ancient horse
    car, clanged its weary way, she might be taken, dot
    and tittle, for Dortrecht. Since the forced abolition
    of The Staple, the most of Dortrecht’s 40,000 inhabitants
    have gone into the more legitimate business
    of shipbuilding. But Wilmington, to achieve this,
    would also have to level off her hills to a certain
    depth below the sea, which might then necessitate the
    diking of the Delaware. It would be a mighty task
    and, after all is said and done, she would gain little
    but history.</p>

    <p>Here in Dortrecht were born the brothers De Witt,
    Cornelius and John, whose equal as councilors and
    statesmen Holland has not been able to reproduce.
    The dome of the ancient Groothoofdpoort, one of
    the town gates of the sixteenth century that stands
    at the harbor end of the Wynstraat, contains, among
    other relics, a collection of medals, many of which
    were struck in commemoration of the tragedy of the
    Binnenhof at The Hague. Nicolas Maes, Albert
    Cuyp, and Ary Scheffer are the three most famous
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>Dutch painters that Dortrecht takes pride in claiming
    as her own.</p>

    <p>Like Leyden, Dortrecht experienced her period of
    siege in the hands of the Spaniards, although of not
    nearly so long duration, and relief was effected in
    much the same manner. Her coat of arms, consisting
    of a milkmaid <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">couchant</i> under her docile bovine
    on a field of&mdash;garlic, we’ll say, strikes forever the
    keynote of the town’s relief.</p>

    <p>It seems that a milkmaid in the employ of a certain
    wealthy farmer living near the city, having gone
    into the fields in pursuit of her daily duties, discovered
    the Spaniards hidden behind the hedges. Probably
    out of pure reticence, bashfulness, timidity,
    downright scared-to-death-ness&mdash;what you will&mdash;she
    took no notice of the ambushed members of the opposite
    sex, but went as gleefully as possible at her
    task, and, having completed it, shouldered her yoke
    and started homeward. It cannot be held against
    her if she did hasten a bit, for a consultation of the
    records will prove that a thunderstorm was gathering
    on the horizon.</p>

    <p>Arriving at the farmhouse, she told her employer
    of what she had seen, and he told the Burgomaster.
    The Burgomaster dispatched a spy, who, in turn,
    discovered that the milkmaid related no myth but a
    cold and brittle fact. Soldiers were mustered forthwith,
    and the dikes were cut, allowing the merciless
    river to rush in and catch the cruel Castilians unawares
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>at their bloody job. It is alleged that Spaniards
    galore were drowned in the raging torrent, and
    many were “utterly disappointed in their design.”
    At all events, the town was saved and the States
    issued orders to the effect that the farmer be reimbursed
    for the loss of his cattle, real estate, and
    personal property, and that the milkmaid’s likeness,
    together with that of her faithful and nonplussible
    cow, be impressed upon the new coinage of the city.
    “And she had, during her life, and hers forever,”
    according to a medieval historian, “an allowance of
    fifty pounds per annum&mdash;a noble requital for a virtuous
    service.”</p>

    <p>The first glimpse of Dortrecht that you get as
    you emerge from its railway station will put you
    at once in sympathy with it. Prefaced by an open,
    sunny, brick-paved space, a long avenue of great
    trees stretches away directly in front, while back in
    their shade stands the peripatetic horse car, as if
    loath to attempt the transfer of passengers in the
    heat of the day. On either side of the avenue are
    beautiful residences, their lawns encircled, not by the
    inappropriate and unsightly fence, but with a narrow
    canal, like a miniature moat, which is bridged only
    at the front and the rear entrances to the grounds.
    Everything seems so peaceful, so conducive to comfort
    and leisure, that you will wish you had the time
    to stay in Dortrecht indefinitely and take up your
    abode near the station&mdash;a wish that even in your
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>wildest flights of fancy would never apply to Wilmington,
    Delaware.</p>

    <p>Import a treacherous-looking Italian in a vivid
    pink shirt and let him stir up the aroma by poling
    his mournful gondola up and down a certain canal
    in Dortrecht, and you will have a scene in Venice
    itself. This canal, spanned at intervals by narrow
    bridges and bordered with three-story houses that
    hang over it menacingly, is obviously the reason why
    so much good stout canvas and so many tubes of
    excellent paint have been used up by Dutch artists
    in picturing Dortrecht; for a little of Venice, they
    must have thought, is better than none at all. In
    view, therefore, of the length, tediousness, and expense
    of a trip to Venice in those days, many of the
    best of the Dutch painters stayed home and exercised
    their talents on that canal in Dortrecht. All of
    which we may consider a boon to the art of the
    Netherlands as well as to the picture-loving public.</p>

    <p>They have a pretty park in that San Francisco
    of Holland that fringes the bank of the Maas. On
    its river side, near the entrance, there is a café, where,
    in the evening, the less romantic Rotterdamer basks
    and imbibes in the throes of a virulent orchestra.
    Farther along under the trees, past the café and overlooking
    the river, numerous benches invite the lover of
    the sea and its ships to sit him down and gaze upon
    the great steel hulls&mdash;and wooden ones, too&mdash;that
    have just returned from, or are about to depart for,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>a lengthy and uncertain argument with Father Neptune.</p>

    <p>The view from here is several times more magnetic

    here, about dusk, come those wizened warriors upon
    whom the sea has cast her spell once and for all time,
    to sit and smoke their pipes upside down and dream,
    perhaps, of other days, of other ships, of other seas.
    Three or four may occupy a single bench, but it
    will be an hour before a word is passed between them.
    It is their only method of rejuvenation, and they are
    loath to be reminded that their day is almost done.
    A certain sort of reverence pervades the place; it
    would seem a blasphemy even to speak aloud.</p>

    <p>On one of these wooden benches I sat one evening
    at sunset, looking out across to the docks on the
    opposite side of the river. Busy little motor boats
    were sputtering hither and thither between the shipping,
    bent upon the fulfillment of their last missions
    of the day. A few hundred yards farther up, a
    couple of gloomy-looking steam ferries, built like
    Rhine river tugs, transferred their deck loads of
    workmen from the different docks and machine shops
    on the Feijenoord to the Westplein landing in Rotterdam.
    From out in the stream came the rattle of
    chain through hawse pipe, as a Portuguese tramp,
    having entered the harbor too late for a stranger
    to dock, was preparing an anchorage for the night.
    Close by lay a Norwegian “wind jammer”&mdash;so close
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>that the two of them might easily have rubbed figure-heads.
    A big cargo boat, bound out, preceded by a
    tiny tug to herald her approach and followed by its
    twin to help keep her straight while passing, an exact
    fit, through the draw to one of the many
    “havens,” bayed sonorously for the less conspicuous
    craft to get out of her way; while alongside the
    Wilhelminakade the upper decks of a great passenger-carrying
    leviathan, already electric lighted,
    showed through the rigging of the intermediate vessels.
    Out of respect for the tide, she was to sail
    at three the next morning, and her passengers, when
    they awakened, would find themselves well down the
    English Channel on their way back to New York
    after a summer in Europe.</p>

    <p>Presently, two young women, pushing a baby-coach
    between them, came strolling along, and took
    up positions at the railing just in front of me.
    Plainly they were English, and, although I strained
    every nerve to overhear their conversation (which
    was mean of me), but could not, I divined the reason
    for their coming. The same thing occurs a dozen
    times a day in Liverpool, in ’Frisco, in Sydney, in
    Valparaiso, in every port of any consequence in
    the world. One was the wife, and the other perhaps
    the sister, or her sister, or maybe a close friend.
    And there was also the kiddy.</p>

    <p>Their vigil was not long in being rewarded, for
    during the three weeks’ absence&mdash;three months’, more
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>likely, if the voyage had been a long one&mdash;they had
    perused the Lloyd reports daily and diligently, and
    with the additional aid of a letter or two, had calculated
    the time of arrival to a nicety.</p>

    <p>Soon a great black hull appeared far down the
    river. Darkness was gathering fast, but they knew
    the lines of that ship as they knew their little gardens
    at home. They un-reticuled their handkerchiefs and
    waved and giggled and giggled and waved. For full
    twenty minutes they waved and giggled, and then
    they held the kiddy up. The ship turned off to enter
    a dock on the opposite side of the stream and, as
    she turned her port beam to us, someone&mdash;it would
    not have been difficult to guess whom&mdash;on her bridge
    held up a navigator’ s three-foot telescope, it having
    been doubtless already very much in hand, and waved
    a brief but significant, “All’s well; see you in two
    hours”&mdash;or waves to that effect.</p>

    <p>Yes, there is still romance in shipping, and Rotterdam,
    being first, last, and all the time a shipping
    town, there is romance in Rotterdam.</p>

    <p>The most satisfactory way of approaching Rotterdam
    is by water, and the most satisfactory water
    way is from Dortrecht. By this route you obtain
    not only the most characteristic views of Rotterdam
    and the bustle and business about her water front,
    but you get also the glimpse of Dortrecht that Albert
    Cuyp availed himself of so often, for the water front
    of Dortrecht doesn’t seem to have changed much,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>according to Cuyp, except in the item of steam for
    sail.</p>

    <p>It is a pleasant trip of an hour and a half
    duration down the Maas, past numerous shipyards
    that are capable of building anything from a canal
    boat to an ocean-going cargo carrier; past great
    suction dredges assigned to the perennial duty of
    keeping the river conquered; past fishers for salmon,
    who, by treaty, may lower their nets only upon
    certain days in order to give the German fishers,
    higher up the stream, an equal opportunity to make
    a living; past little hamlets whose river docks and
    picturesque dock tenders serve in lieu of railway stations
    and the more prosaic red-capped and frock-coated
    station masters.</p>

    <p>But Rotterdam, by reason of her trade, does not
    coincide with the general idea of Holland. She is
    more or less cosmopolitan, to be sure, but this phase
    strikes the traveler less forcibly than her ardent
    activity. What with her electric cranes and machine shops
    and sugar refineries and tobacco factories and
    shipbuilding yards and distilleries, she gives one the
    impression of a thriving German seaport. The home
    port claimed by the greater number of the seven
    hundred or more steam and sailing vessels that make
    up the merchant marine of Holland, is Rotterdam,
    and through this port passes at least one-half the
    country’s total imports by sea and almost as much
    of her exports, together with four-fifths of Holland’s
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>trade with the Rhine. But Baltimore, in the matter
    of population, would make two of this, the most
    active, the most important seaport of the Netherlands.</p>

    <p>Still, Rotterdam is essentially Dutch, in fact if
    not in first appearances. She has her Groote Kerk,
    the Church of St. Lawrence, begun in 1412; she has
    her Town Hall, without which, it seems, no town in
    Holland could survive; she has her picture gallery,
    although a mediocre one, in the Boymans Museum;
    she has her old market and her new church; and she
    has her fish market, where women of the most uncertain
    antiquity sit and gossip and knit and sell
    sole between stitches. Here and there, too, she has
    her old windmill, thatch covered, browbeaten by the
    weather, massive and ponderous-looking, that, in the
    very midst of twentieth century hurry and scurry,
    waves its stiff arms as if depicting in pantomime a
    scene of other days. And then, in striking contrast,
    right at the very edge of the old harbor, stands the
    tallest building in the Netherlands. It must be as
    sky-scraping as eight or ten stories, and high up
    under its eaves it displays the advertisement of an
    American breakfast food. Its builders probably
    thought that a photographer would be the only mortal
    who could be induced to rent the top story, so
    they made the building’s sloping roof into one glorious
    skylight, under which rural Holland might sit
    and have its picture taken for the family album.</p>

    <p class="center">In spite of its up-to-date spirit, Rotterdam is
    essentially Dutch, with the canals much in evidence</p>
    </div>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
    <p>It was while waiting for a car at the beginning of
    The Oosterkade and just across the old harbor from
    this Metropolitan Tower of Rotterdam that the more
    nearly general of all Dutch customs was brought
    home to me.</p>

    <p>The car had approached its terminus and I was
    about to mount, when the conductor, more forcibly
    than politely, requested that I discontinue the attempt
    and take up my position where I belonged, with the
    rest of the crowd, in the vicinity of a certain lamp-post
    a few steps beyond&mdash;the Dutch being most precise
    and systematic. I ambled thither and was
    standing in the more or less protecting umbrage of
    the lamp-post, with sarcastic but not envious mien,
    watching the traction company partake of a large
    slab of black bread and cheese (until the disappearance
    of which the car refused to continue) when I
    was accosted by a small street urchin of about the
    tender age of seven, who was armed with an immense
    cigar. I happened to be smoking at the time, and
    this was what brought the boy in my direction. He
    wanted a light and wasted no words in asking for
    it. Being somewhat shocked that a youth of such
    tender years should be so faithful a slave to the
    vile, pernicious weed, I submitted to his plea under
    mental protest. But he seemed not in the least embarrassed,
    for he saluted and marched off, apparently
    enjoying the thing as if it had been his fifth
    since breakfast.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
    <p>Before I was through with Holland, however, I
    came to know that every able-bodied male in the
    kingdom acquires the cigar habit as early in life
    as his physical condition permits, and I have yet
    to see the adult Dutchman who doesn’t use tobacco
    in some form. Holland, by virtue of her colonial
    holdings in Sumatra and the Straits Settlements,
    is the paradise of smokers, and tobacco stores in
    every town, be it large or small, are as thick as
    saloons in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. If you pay
    more than the equal value of two American cents
    for a cigar in Holland you are branded as a foreigner
    or an extravagant roué. Of course foreigners
    who unfurl their native colors full in the face of the
    tobacconist are expected to and do pay more, but
    a cigar equal in flavor and composition to the best
    of our ten cent brands can be bought in Holland
    for five Dutch cents, and often less, if you go about
    it in the proper manner. The age at which boys
    learn to smoke in Holland has never been correctly
    computed, but in the country I have seen lads of
    five or six serenely eliminating all possible chance
    of being rewarded the oft-referred-to gold watch at
    the age of twenty-one, and handling their cigars with
    as much real enjoyment as their paternal grandparent.</p>

    <p>Perhaps at this point it might be opportune to
    tell the story of old Herr van Klaes of this same
    town of Rotterdam, who consumed a five-ounce package
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>of tobacco daily and died in action at the age
    of ninety-eight with his pipe actually in his mouth.
    In his will he expressed the wish that every smoker
    in the kingdom be invited to his funeral “by letter,
    circular, and advertisement,” and all who took advantage
    of the invitation should be presented with
    ten pounds of tobacco and two pipes, the name of
    van Klaes, his crest, and the date of his demise to
    be engraved upon the latter. Every poor man in
    the neighborhood who accompanied the bier was to
    receive a large package of smoking mixture on each
    anniversary of the death of his champion. The will
    stipulated further that all who wished to partake
    of its benefits must smoke “without interruption
    during the entire ceremony.” The body was to be
    placed in a coffin lined with the wood of his old
    cigar boxes, and at the foot should be placed a
    package of French tobacco and one of the Dutch
    blend. At his side in the coffin was to be laid his
    favorite pipe and a box of matches, “For,” he said,
    “one never knows what may happen.” And all persons
    in the funeral procession were requested to
    sprinkle the ashes of their pipes upon the bier as
    they passed it while taking their departure from
    the grounds.</p>

    <p>It is said the funeral of Herr van Klaes at least
    enjoyed the distinction of being the largest seen in
    Rotterdam in many a day. It must have been a
    busy time for the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">aanspreker</i>.
    Indeed, it must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
    taken the concentrated efforts of all the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">aansprekers</i>
    in Holland to help advertise the funeral. But here a
    few lines as to the solution of the word “<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">aanspreker</i>.”</p>

    <p>The Dutch <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">aanspreker</i> is he of the mourning robes
    whose duty it is to go about from house to house,
    wherever even the flimsiest ties, whether social or
    business, exist, and announce the saddening news of
    a death; or it is he of the more gaudy apparel who
    gives the gladsome tidings of a birth in the family&mdash;and
    the degree of his mournfulness or jocundity in
    appearance bespeaks the mournfulness or jocundity
    of his employers.</p>

    <p>In earlier times the services of the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">aanspreker</i> were
    augmented by those of the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">huilebalk</i>, a kind of a
    professional mourner, who, in the case of a death,
    accompanied the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">aanspreker</i> on his rounds and wept
    more or less fluently after the completion of each
    doleful message. His coat was long-tailed and his
    hat wide-brimmed and the extent of his sorrow in
    each case depended wholly upon the receipts for his
    services; the more money, the more tears. Both
    must have been depressing professions at best, but
    this manner of announcing the news constituted an
    essential factor of every funeral. The <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">aanspreker</i>
    is often seen to-day, but the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">huilebalk</i> has wept himself
    out of existence, probably on account of a
    simple dearth of apprentices.</p>

    <p>The patron saint, almost, of Rotterdam is
    Gherardt Gherardts, better known by the more poetic
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>name of Erasmus Desiderius&mdash;meaning “beloved and
    long desired”&mdash;scholar, critic, philosopher, intellectual
    fly-by-night, born in Rotterdam in 1466. A
    bronze statue of him by Hendrik de Keyser decorates
    the Groote Markt of his birthplace. Known best by
    his immortal satire, “The Praise of Folly,” and for
    his being, in 1516, the first to be so bold as to amend
    the text of the Greek New Testament, Erasmus was
    undoubtedly the “intellectual dictator of his age.”
    He entered the order of the Brethren of the Common
    Life, first at ’S Hertogenbosch and later at Delft,
    and the year America was discovered saw him acting
    as secretary to the Bishop of Cambrai. He studied
    in Paris, in Orleans, in Oxford, in Rome, and then
    returned to England to accept a professorship at the
    University of Cambridge. He died in Basle in 1536.</p>

    <p>Rotterdam cannot be said to be noted for its
    cleanliness; in fact, it crowds Amsterdam for first
    place as the dirtiest city in Holland. But still Rotterdam
    as well as Amsterdam has its beauty spots.
    Some of the residence streets in the newer part of
    the city are veritable gardens in themselves. The
    Parklaan, with the Park at one end and the Grooteveerhaven,
    the latter crowded with private motor
    boats and yachts that gleam in their innocence of
    dirt, at the other, is lined with beautiful homes. It
    and the Mauritsweg and the Eendragtsweg are
    tree studded and kept swept and sprinkled quite as
    thoroughly and as frequently as any of the streets
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>in The Hague. The canal that borders these two
    latter streets is banked with lawns and crossed here
    and there by artistic rustic bridges, for in Rotterdam,
    as in the German municipalities, they pay more
    attention to the details of city beautification than
    do we in America. The community at large seems to
    take a personal interest in such affairs. Can you
    imagine the linemen for a telegraph company or
    an electric light corporation coming along the streets
    of a German city, exercising the right of eminent
    domain by ripping up the pavements of the property
    holders and digging holes big enough to bury a horse,
    in which to plant the unsightly wooden poles that
    seem to them, on account of their comparative cheapness,
    the only known method of carrying wires? The
    Germans wouldn’t stand it for a minute. They use
    steel wire carriers over there&mdash;a more businesslike
    looking trestle work in the shape of an elongated
    truncated pyramid, set slightly <em>above</em> the ground on
    a concrete foundation. And I noticed that these
    “trestle” telegraph poles in Rotterdam, when the
    conditions permitted, were planted in the center of
    a little bed of geraniums, while some even had vines
    climbing upon them.</p>

    <p>The Dutch, too, are sticklers for coziness and
    they try to make their living quarters as habitable
    as possible. In the congested harbors of Rotterdam,
    where, sometimes, you can step from one side of
    the stream to the other upon the flat decks of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>swarms of canal boats, it is doubtful if you will see
    an uncurtained cabin window, and pots of flowers
    will be displayed in most of them. The train shed
    of the Beurs railway station in the heart of the
    city has an outside cornice of flower boxes filled with
    pink geraniums. But then, you will remember about
    the Dutch locomotives&mdash;which accounts for much.</p>

    <p>As you enter Rotterdam or Amsterdam on the
    railway you pass row after row of what we please
    to call tenement houses. Even these are not devoid
    of a cozy, homelike aspect that our tenements and
    even reasonably inexpensive apartment houses know
    not. Each apartment can boast of a balcony in
    the rear that is partitioned off from its neighbors.
    In many cases these balconies are shaded with awnings
    from the glare of the sun and decorated with
    flowerpots in profusion. This serves the city
    dweller in lieu of a garden, and here he eats his
    meals and spends his evenings after work. In the
    daytime the family use the balcony as an improvised
    sewing room. Many of the back yards of the
    smaller houses consist of a tree lined canal over
    which the family looks from the seclusion of a flower
    girdled, awning covered veranda.</p>

    <p>The Dutch not only keep themselves cozy but
    they take a tender sort of interest in the well-being
    of their birds and dumb animals. True, they train
    their dogs to help their masters pull the milk carts
    or vegetable wagons, but the dogs look husky and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>well fed and seem to take pride in their accomplishment.
    A spare-ribbed stray canine prowling around
    the neighborhood is an unknown quantity in Holland.</p>

    <p>In the center of some of Rotterdam’s canals which
    are barred to traffic and made, instead, to assist
    in the beautification of the city, you will see little
    wicker duck nests, like empty market baskets turned
    on their sides. They rest on piles driven into
    the bottom of the canal, and the entrance to each
    is approached from the water by means of a wooden
    incline about the size of a shingle. This is not only
    a convenience for the ducks but features as an artistic
    break in the monotony, I might say, of the canal.</p>

    <p>And these are but a few of the reasons why a visit
    to Rotterdam, although barren of the types and
    characteristics that Holland is noted for, is well
    worth the trouble; if only to study the city and its
    inhabitants from a psychological point of view it is
    well worth while.</p>

    <h2 title="V Delft and Her Tragedy">V<br />
    <span class="chap_name">Delft and Her Tragedy</span></h2>


    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Nineteen</span> minutes in the train from Rotterdam,
    and you are in Delft&mdash;such are the distances
    between towns in South Holland.</p>

    <p>The population of Delft amounts, numerically, to
    some 32,000, but this is an item that is farthest from
    your thoughts. It is one of the quietest, quaintest
    cities in the Netherlands. Up and down its narrow,
    lime shaded canals the boatmen of Delft pole their
    barges laboriously, yet noiselessly, walking along the
    decks from stem to stern against their padded means
    of propulsion and literally pushing their craft out
    from under them. In the spring these watery highways
    are covered with a fragrant layer of fallen
    blossoms; in the fall, with leaves of variegated colors.
    The houses that stand behind the trees have been
    well built and are well preserved, adding to the place
    an impression of comfortable solidity.</p>

    <p>My first visit to Holland brought me to Delft from
    “The Hook” at a very early hour in the morning,
    when the housemaids were about to commence the
    first concentrated assault of the day upon their
    pavements, doorsteps, front doors, and the brass-work
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>pertaining thereto in the shape of knobs and
    knockers. “Scrub” seemed to be the housemaids’
    slogan, and they were certainly living up to it.
    Pail after pail of water was hoisted from the canals
    and splashed over everything in reach, until it flowed
    across the streets and pavements, and fell back
    whence it came originally. If I had appeared upon
    the scene a little later I might have concluded that
    a cloud-burst had struck the town. And all this
    brackish water, that, in the canals, comes within
    an ace of being absolutely stagnant, being poured
    so recklessly over the town, gave to it a kind of
    antique odor, anything but pleasant to inhale. It
    gave every evidence that that same water had been
    hoisted, put to its task, and allowed to drip back
    into the canals again since medieval times.</p>

    <p>This was on a week day. A subsequent visit to
    Delft took me there on Sunday.</p>

    <p>Now, for some reason, psychological or otherwise,
    the housemaids of Delft don’t seem to take the same
    interest in the scrupulousness of their doorsteps on
    a Sunday that they do on a week day. Sunday is
    the day that everybody in Delft dons his or her
    best bib and tucker and goes to church, or leans
    over the railings of the canal bridges and chats with
    a friend, or walks about the town under the shade
    of its trees, contemplating, perhaps, upon the exigencies
    of life. And a housemaid is but human.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_060.jpg" alt="" width="656" height="400" />
    <p class="center">The East Gate of Delft, one of the quaintest and
    quietest cities of the Netherlands</p>
    </div>

    <p>To come upon Delft, therefore, during this weekly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>interruption in the perennial polishing of the town,
    whatever the reason for it, offers the traveler a
    different and vastly more agreeable impression. He
    will see Delft and her people at their best, the latter
    more congenially courteous, the former more serenely
    stolid. Instead of the boatmen being continually
    in the act of disturbing the bottoms of the canals
    with their poles, so that the housemaids can skim
    off the most graveolent of it with which to scour
    and rinse their pavements, they assume for the day
    the rôle of flower sellers. Boats bearing fragrant
    burdens of potted plants of every variety, and cut
    flowers as well, as if to try to make amends for the
    mal-odor of the previous week, will be drawn as close
    to the sidewalks as the banks of the canals permit,
    in order to tempt the frailty of the Delft housewife&mdash;if
    an inherent love of flowers may be termed as such&mdash;on
    her way home from church.</p>

    <p>Delft is old and she show’s symptoms of the fact
    in spots. Down at the southern end of the city, near
    the Rotterdam gate, stands a venerable building,
    once one of the numerous warehouses scattered over
    the country belonging to the Dutch East India Company&mdash;that
    most famous and wealthiest of all Dutch
    trading concerns, founded in 1602, when the power
    and wealth of the Republic had attained their high-water
    marks under the stadtholdership of Maurice,
    one of the sons of the ill-fated Prince William of
    Orange. The place has long since been put to use
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>as a military storehouse. Directly opposite is the
    ominous-looking city arsenal, bearing above its
    arched entrance a massive copy of the arms of the
    old Dutch Republic, carved in stone. Another of
    the old buildings is the Gemeelandshuis van Delftland,
    showing in sandstone a rich Gothic façade of the beginning
    of the sixteenth century.</p>

    <p>With us, Delft’s principal claim to notoriety lies
    in the manufacture of its faience, commonly called
    “Delft ware,” in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
    Its composition and design at first copied
    from the Chinese and Japanese porcelain, this faience
    became celebrated throughout the world. Dutch designs
    were soon substituted for the Oriental, and the
    industry prospered proportionately. Later it lapsed
    into decay and the true process has been revived in
    Delft only within comparatively recent years. A
    large plant for its manufacture now operates on the
    Oosteinde, not far from the New Church.</p>

    <p>But in the heart of the Hollander, Delft will ever
    be revered as the scene of the tragedy that cut short
    the life and terminated the praiseworthy deeds of
    that eminent founder of Dutch liberty, “William the
    Silent,” Prince of Orange, the George Washington
    of the Netherlands.</p>

    <p>Born of noble German parentage at Dillenburg in
    the Duchy of Nassau in 1533, William, curiously
    enough, became the favorite of Philip <abbr title="2">II</abbr> of Spain,
    who appointed him, in 1559, when but twenty-six
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>years of age, <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">stadtholder</i> or governor of the provinces
    of Zeeland, Holland, Friesland, and Utrecht. Two
    years later William found himself in bad odor with
    Granvella, the Bishop of Arras, whom Philip had
    appointed as counselor to his half-sister, Margaret
    of Parma, the then regent of the Netherlands. William
    finally effected the enforced relinquishment of
    this post by the Bishop in 1564.</p>

    <p>The subsequent unrest in the Netherlands, provoked
    mainly by the atrocities of Spanish soldiery,
    led to the sanguinary assignment of Ferdinando Alvarez
    de Toledo, Duke of Alva, to command an
    army of 10,000 picked men, mustered from Lombardy,
    Sardinia, Sicily, and Naples, to quell the
    possible insurrection. This move was bitterly resented,
    not only by her subjects, but was opposed,
    although without success, by Margaret of Parma
    herself; for the name of Alva was as odious to her
    as it was to them.</p>

    <p>A man of brilliant military attainments and the
    most experienced general in Europe at the time, but
    bubbling over with avarice and revengefulness, cruel
    and overbearing, Alva accepted the assignment with
    alacrity. “I have tamed people of iron in my day,”
    he was reported to have said contemptuously; “shall
    I not easily crush these men of butter?”</p>

    <p>When Alva, with his army, entered the Netherlands
    and took it upon himself, after much intrigue
    and conniving, to supersede the half-sister of his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>sovereign as governor of the province, the Prince of
    Orange retired to Dillenburg. Continued oppressions
    by the Spaniards later called him to arms with the
    French Huguenots as allies, and he set out betimes
    upon an unsuccessful campaign to liberate the southern
    provinces from their yoke of Spanish tyranny.
    Since that time he was ever an active revolutionist.
    In 1571 he championed the “Water Beggars,”
    by which name those insurgents who assisted their
    compatriots by sea were known, and one year later,
    having been invited by the provinces of Zeeland and
    Holland to command their troops against the Spaniards,
    he captured Middelburg, and later came to the
    successful rescue of the besieged town of Leyden.
    Soon after the formation of the famous defensive
    league known as the “Utrecht Union,” William was
    condemned to exile by Philip. The fact that the
    States-General defied the sovereign’s authority in this
    matter was the percussion cap that exploded the
    general uprising and the throwing off of Dutch allegiance
    to Spain in 1581.</p>

    <p>“Uneasy lies the head that wears”&mdash;the helmet
    of revolt, and from the time of his first attempt to
    achieve the success of his ambitious project, the
    life of no medieval ruler was ever more in jeopardy
    than was that of William of Orange. Within a
    period of two years five separate and distinct attempts
    to take his life had been perpetrated, and a
    sixth, albeit an abhorrently successful one, was about
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>to follow&mdash;all of which were undoubtedly at the initial
    instigation of the Duke of Alva.</p>

    <p>Just across the canal from the Old Church at
    Delft still stands the house of William the Silent,
    now known as the Prinsenhof, where the tragedy took
    place. It is a low, two-story building with a red-tiled
    roof, formerly a cloister, but fitted up in 1575
    as the residence of the Princes of Orange. Here
    came William, in the summer of 1584, to join his
    fourth wife, Louisa de Coligny, at the christening of
    their son, born in Delft the previous winter, who
    later became the celebrated governor, Frederic William.
    The door marked <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gymnasium Publicum</i>,
    opposite the tower of the church, leads through a
    courtyard to the staircase where the murder was
    committed; and in a dark corner of the wall at the
    foot of the steps the custodian will show you a hole
    made by one of the bullets that killed the Prince.
    The dining-room beyond, from which William had
    come to his death, is now a museum containing
    reminiscences of him.</p>

    <p>The Czolgosz of the occasion, the perpetrator of
    the dastardly act, was Bathazar Gérard, alias Francis
    Guion, the self-alleged son of a martyred Calvinist,
    a religious fanatic who had long cherished an insane
    desire to murder Orange.</p>

    <p>“The organization of Bathazar Gérard,” says
    Motley, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>“would furnish a subject for profound
    study, both for the physiologist and the metaphysician.
    Neither wholly a fanatic nor entirely a ruffian,
    he combined the most dangerous elements of both
    characters. In his puny body and mean exterior
    were inclosed considerable mental powers and accomplishments,
    a daring ambition, and a courage almost
    superhuman. Yet those qualities led him only to
    form upon the threshold of life a deliberate determination
    to achieve greatness by the assassin’s trade.”</p>

    <p>After long and exasperating delays, Gérard had
    finally succeeded, on account of his ambitions, in
    nursing himself into the good graces of Alexander
    of Parma, the Spanish governor of the Netherlands
    at that time. On the other hand, “Parma had long
    been looking for a good man to murder Orange,
    feeling&mdash;as Philip, Granvelle, and all former governors
    of the Netherlands had felt&mdash;that this was
    the only means of saving the royal authority in any
    part of the provinces. Many unsatisfactory assassins
    had presented themselves from time to time, and
    Alexander had paid money in hand to various individuals&mdash;Italians,
    Spaniards, Lorrainers, Scotchmen,
    Englishmen, who had generally spent the sums received
    without attempting the job. Others were supposed
    to be still engaged in the enterprise, and at
    that moment there were four persons&mdash;each unknown
    to the others, and of different nations&mdash;in the city
    of Delft, seeking to compass the death of William
    the Silent.”</p>

    <p>Upon the death, at this time, of the French Duke
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>of Anjou, Gérard was recommended to Parma by
    various parties as a capable messenger “to carry
    this important intelligence to the Prince of Orange.”
    Concerning the outcome of this mission, I can do
    no better than to quote John Lothrop Motley from
    his “<cite class="plain">The Rise of the Dutch Republic</cite>,” as I have
    done elsewhere in this chapter:</p>

    <p>“The dispatches having been intrusted to him”
    (Gérard), “he traveled post-haste to Delft, and to
    his astonishment the letters had hardly been delivered
    before he was summoned in person to the
    chamber of the Prince. Here was an opportunity
    such as he had never dared to hope for. The arch-enemy
    to the Church and to the human race” (that
    is, the Prince, so called), “whose death would confer
    upon his destroyer wealth and nobility in this
    world, besides a crown of glory in the next, lay
    unarmed, alone, in bed, before the man who had
    thirsted seven long years for his blood.</p>

    <p>“Bathazar could scarcely control his emotions
    sufficiently to answer the questions which the Prince
    addressed to him concerning the death of Anjou;
    but Orange, deeply engaged with the dispatches, and
    with the reflections which their deeply important contents
    suggested, did not observe the countenance of
    the humble Calvinist exile, who had been recently
    recommended to his patronage by Villers. Gérard
    had, moreover, made no preparation for an interview
    so entirely unexpected, had come unarmed, and had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>formed no plan for escape. He was obliged to
    forego his prey when most within his reach, and
    after communicating all the information which the
    Prince required, he was dismissed from the chamber.</p>

    <p>“It was Sunday morning, and the bells were tolling
    for church. Upon leaving the house he loitered about
    the courtyard, furtively examining the premises, so
    that a sergeant of halberdiers asked him why he
    was waiting there. Bathazar meekly replied that he
    was desirous of attending divine worship in the church
    opposite, but added, pointing to his shabby and
    travel-stained attire, that, without at least a pair
    of new shoes and stockings, he was unfit to join
    the congregation. Insignificant as ever, the small,
    pious, dusty stranger excited no suspicion in the mind
    of the good-natured sergeant. He forthwith spoke
    of the wants of Gérard to an officer, by whom they
    were communicated to Orange himself, and the Prince
    instantly ordered a sum of money to be given him.
    Thus Bathazar obtained from William’s charity what
    Parma’s thrift had denied&mdash;a fund for carrying out
    his purpose!</p>

    <p class="center">The Prinsenhof in Delft, revered by every Hollander as
    the scene where “William the Silent,” the George Washington of the
    Netherlands, was murdered</p>
    </div>

    <p>“Next morning, with the money thus procured, he
    purchased a pair of pistols or small carabines from
    a soldier, chaffering long about the price because
    the vender could not supply a particular kind of
    chopped bullets or slugs which he desired. Before
    the sunset of the following day that soldier had
    stabbed himself to the heart, and died despairing,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>on hearing for what purpose the pistols had been
    bought.</p>

    <p>“On Tuesday, the 10th of July, 1584, at about
    half-past twelve, the Prince, with his wife on his
    arm, and followed by the ladies and gentlemen of
    his family, was going to the dining-room. William
    the Silent was dressed upon that day, according to
    his usual custom, in very plain fashion. He wore
    a wide-leaved, loosely-shaped hat of dark felt, with
    a silken cord round the crown&mdash;such as had been
    worn by the Beggars in the early days of the revolt.
    A high ruff encircled his neck, from which also depended
    one of the Beggars’ medals, with the motto,
    ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fideles au roy jusqu’ a la besace</i>,’ while a loose
    surcoat of gray frieze cloth, over a tawny leather
    doublet, with wide, slashed underclothes, completed his
    costume. Gérard presented himself at the doorway,
    and demanded a passport. The Princess, struck with
    the pale and agitated countenance of the man,
    anxiously questioned her husband concerning the
    stranger. The Prince carelessly observed that ‘it
    was merely a person who came for a passport,’
    ordering, at the same time, a secretary forthwith to
    prepare one. The Princess, still not relieved, observed
    in an undertone that ‘she had never seen so
    villainous a countenance.’ Orange, however, not at
    all impressed with the appearance of Gérard, conducted
    himself at table with his usual cheerfulness,
    conversing much with the burgomaster of Leeuwarden,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>the only guest present at the family dinner, concerning
    the political and religious aspects of Friesland.
    At two o’clock the company rose from table. The
    Prince led the way, intending to pass to his private
    apartments above. The dining-room, which was on
    the ground floor, opened into a little square vestibule,
    which communicated, through an arched passageway,
    with the main entrance into the courtyard. This
    vestibule was also directly at the foot of the wooden
    staircase leading to the next floor, and was scarcely
    six feet in width. Upon its left side, as one approached
    the stairway, was an obscure arch, sunk
    deep in the wall, and completely in the shadow of
    the door. Behind this arch a portal opened to the
    narrow lane at the side of the house. The stairs
    themselves were completely lighted by a large window
    halfway up the flight. The Prince came from the
    dining-room, and began leisurely to ascend. He had
    only reached the second stair, when a man emerged
    from the sunken arch, and, standing within a foot
    or two of him, discharged a pistol full at his heart.
    Three balls entered his body, one of which, passing
    quite through him, struck with violence against the
    wall beyond. The Prince is said to have exclaimed in
    French, as he felt the wound, ‘O my God, have mercy
    upon my soul! O my God, have mercy upon this poor
    people!’</p>

    <p>“These were the last words he ever spoke, save
    that when his sister, Catherine of Schwartzburg, immediately
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>afterwards asked him if he commended his
    soul to Jesus Christ, he faintly answered, ‘Yes.’
    His master of the horse, Jacob van Maldere, had
    caught him in his arms as the fatal shot was fired.
    The Prince was then placed on the stairs for an
    instant, when he immediately began to swoon. He
    was afterwards laid upon a couch in the dining-room,
    where in a few minutes he breathed his last in the
    arms of his wife and sister.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

    <p>“The murderer succeeded in making his escape
    through the side door, and sped swiftly up the
    narrow lane. He had almost reached the ramparts,
    from which he intended to spring into the moat, when
    he stumbled over a heap of rubbish. As he rose he
    was seized by several pages and halberdiers, who had
    pursued him from the house. He had dropped his
    pistols upon the spot where he had committed the
    crime, and upon his person were found a couple of
    bladders, provided with a piece of pipe, with which
    he had intended to assist himself across the moat,
    beyond which a horse was waiting for him. He
    made no effort to deny his identity, but boldly
    avowed himself and his deed. He was brought back
    to the house, where he immediately underwent a preliminary
    examination before the city magistrates.
    He was afterwards subjected to excruciating tortures;
    for the fury against the wretch who had
    destroyed the father of the country was uncontrollable,
    and William the Silent was no longer alive to
    intercede&mdash;as he had often done before&mdash;in behalf
    of those who assailed his life.”</p>

    <p>The tortures that the man endured prior to his
    speedy execution are unmentionable.</p>

    <p>“William of Orange,” continues Motley, “at the
    period of his death, was aged fifty-one years and sixteen
    days. He left twelve children. By his first
    wife, Anne of Egmont, he had one son, Philip, and
    one daughter, Mary, afterwards married to Count
    Hohenlo. By his second wife, Anna of Saxony, he
    had one son, the celebrated Maurice of Nassau, and
    two daughters, Anna, married afterwards to her
    cousin, Count William Louis, and Emilie, who espoused
    the pretender of Portugal, Prince Emanuel.
    By Charlotte of Bourbon, his third wife, he had six
    daughters; and by his fourth, Louisa de Coligny,
    one son, Frederic William, afterwards <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">stadtholder</i>
    of the Republic in her most palmy days. The
    Prince was entombed on the 3rd of August at Delft,
    amid the tears of a whole nation. Never was a more
    extensive, unaffected, and legitimate sorrow felt at
    the death of any human being.”</p>

    <p>So passed the greatest man that little Holland
    ever did or ever will produce. His ashes lie in a
    vault in the Nieuwe Kerk of Delft, together with
    those of thirty-five other princes and princesses of
    the House of Orange, the last being King William <abbr title="3">III</abbr>,
    father of the present Queen, who died on November
    23rd, 1890. Above the vault stands the handsome
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>and imposing marble monument to William the Silent,
    worked by the de Keysers, begun by the father in
    1616 and finished by the son. A translation of the
    Latin epitaph of the Prince reads as follows:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

    <p>In honor of God Almighty and for an eternal memorial
    of William of Nassau, Prince of Orange, father of his
    fatherland, who valued the welfare of the Netherlands more
    than his own interests or those of his family; who twice,
    and principally at his own expense, collected powerful armies
    and led them into the field under the command of the States;
    who averted the tyranny of Spain; called back and restored
    the true religion and the ancient laws; who at last left the
    nearly regained liberty to be confirmed by his son, Prince
    Maurice, heir to the virtues of his father; the truly pious,
    prudent and invincible hero, whom Philip <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, King of Spain,
    that terror of Europe, feared, but could neither subdue nor
    intimidate, but killed with gross perfidiousness by the hand
    of a hired murderer, the United Provinces have ordered this
    to be erected as an eternal memorial of his merits.</p></div>

    <p>Motley’s phraseology with regard to the Prince’s
    attributes and ambitions cannot be improved upon.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

    <p>“His firmness was allied to his piety. His constancy
    in bearing the whole weight of a struggle,
    as unequal as men have ever undertaken, was the
    theme of admiration, even to his enemies. The rock
    in the ocean, ‘tranquil amid raging billows,’ was the
    favorite emblem by which his friends expressed their
    sense of his firmness. From the time when, as a
    hostage in France, he first discovered the plan of
    Philip to plant the Inquisition in the Netherlands,
    up to the last moment of his life, he never faltered
    in his determination to resist the iniquitous scheme.
    This resistance was the labor of his life. To exclude
    the Inquisition, to maintain the ancient liberties of
    his country, was the task which he appointed to himself
    when a youth of three-and-twenty. Never speaking
    a word concerning a heavenly mission, never deluding
    himself or others with the usual phraseology
    of enthusiasts, he accomplished the task through
    danger, amid toils, and with sacrifices such as few
    men have ever been able to make on their country’s
    altar.”</p>

    <p>Truly, Wilhelmina has an illustrious ancestor.</p>

    so sure about the veracity of the first two clauses,
    but you can certainly spend it at The Hague.</p>

    <p>The Hague is at once the most beautiful and the
    most expensive city in Holland. It is the Paris, the
    Washington, the Berlin of the Netherlands all in
    one. Like Paris, it is so overflowing with history
    and art that it would take a small book to tell of
    it all in detail; like Washington, it is beautiful, and
    the official residence of the chief executive of the
    nation and the diplomatic corps, but not half so
    expensive; like Berlin, again it is just as beautiful
    and twice as expensive. It is the magnetic pole of
    the American tourist in Holland, and it takes pains
    to cater in many ways to his whims and fancies, not
    to mention his pocketbook, and thus hold his patronage.
    Half the town speaks English and most of the
    remaining half understands it. Its people are obliging
    and courteous and seem to take a personal interest
    in making your stay one of pleasure and instruction
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>as they do in no other city in Europe.
    In The Hague I have tried to explain to an obtuse
    conductor, in smatterings of German, Dutch, and
    English, where I wished to get off the car, and half
    a dozen fellow-passengers, finding a stranger in difficulty,
    have chimed in without the least solicitation
    and untangled my knots of pantomime with real
    Dutch verbiage.</p>

    <p>But, being the tourist center that it is, it has
    naturally developed the old familiar nuisance to be
    found in all cities of its ilk in Europe: the piratical
    parasite who stands in ambush behind the hotel porter
    as you start out in the morning and tags along
    halfway to your destination, shouting an incessant
    “Do you vont a guite, sir? Do you vont a guite?”
    You will find him in almost every part of the town,
    but his particular lair is in the lee of the picture
    galleries. Either by instinct or by abnormal powers
    of observation he knows that the average tourist
    whose time is limited will make a bee line for the
    nearest picture gallery before he has even had an
    opportunity to unpack his grip. So here near the
    galleries the guide awaits the coming of his prey.
    If you succumb to his prattle, all is lost, save the
    hope that he may soon run out of things to show
    you. But an excellent entertainment for a party
    of, say, four or five is to club together and hire a
    guide, let him take you whither he will, and, during
    the process, keep him under a rapid fire of questions
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>so foolish and insipid that it will tax his ingenuity
    even to answer them incorrectly&mdash;as, you may remember,
    Mark Twain and his friend overwhelmed
    their guide in Genoa. This is the only way to obtain
    value received with&mdash;more often, without&mdash;respect
    to the guide, for his sense of humor is proverbially
    null and void and affords a vulnerable
    target.</p>

    <p>And a wonder it is to me that some of these “old
    master” centers do not consider us Americans the
    most appreciative of art of any people in the world.
    They must think that we are picture and cathedral
    crazy&mdash;and I have no doubt they do, and snicker up
    their sleeves in lieu of a less ill-mannered outburst.
    Granted that in itself it is an education to see the
    famous pictures&mdash;I admit that there are other things
    in the world just as wonderful as old paintings, many
    of which are of notoriously poor draughtsmanship
    but have become famous merely from the fact that
    the paint still retains its luster after three hundred
    and some years. We pay too little attention to the
    life of the cities and the traits of their peoples as
    they are found to-day.</p>

    <p>But I digress. This is not a lecture on the marvels
    or fallacies of art.</p>

    <p>The site of The Hague was originally a hunting-park
    owned and operated by the Counts of Holland
    who used to come over frequently from Haarlem to
    hunt their deer. From this fact it derived its Dutch
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>nomenclature, ’S Graven Hage, meaning “the Count’s
    inclosure.” The allurements of the place must have
    been to the detriment of official business in Haarlem,
    for they felled most of the trees with which it was
    overgrown and transferred thither the seat of government
    about the middle of the thirteenth century.
    Beginning with Maurice of Nassau in 1593, it became
    the official residence of the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">stadtholder</i> of the
    Republic.</p>

    <p>Having been thus honored as the capital of Dutch
    statesmanship in the early days, the main historical
    curiosity in The Hague is the Binnenhof, a group
    of ancient buildings where the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">stadtholders</i> lived and
    worked and had their being and tried to dissolve
    frequent plots for their own extermination. Here
    William <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, Count of Holland and afterward elected
    Emperor of Germany, built a castle in 1250, which,
    forty years later, was enlarged and fitted up for a
    permanent residence by his son, Floris <abbr title="5">V</abbr>. At the
    east of the Binnenhof stands the old gabled and
    turreted Hall of the Knights, erected at the time of
    Floris and recently restored and put into use for
    legislative purposes.</p>

    <p>But those days, however glorious from the point of
    view of national advancement, were also the days of
    plot and intrigue, and there is scarce an historical
    building in Holland but might tell its tale of a tragedy.
    On the 13th of May, 1619, the seventy-two
    year old prime minister of the nation at the time,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>Jan van Oldenbarnevelt, was put to death on a
    scaffold erected in the Binnenhof “for having conspired
    to dismember the States of the Netherlands,
    and greatly troubled God’s church,” according to
    Maurice of Orange, whose displeasure he had incurred.
    The learned Grotius, scholar and statesman
    and the then senator from Rotterdam, who was
    arrested at the same time as Oldenbarnevelt for
    alleged conspiracy with him, was sentenced to prison
    for life in the castle of Loevenstein, near Gorinchem.
    Happily, however, with the help of his wife, he
    effected means of escape ere he had been confined a
    full year.</p>

    <p>Hard by the Binnenhof stands the old Gevangenpoort,
    now containing a morbidly interesting collection
    of guillotine blocks that have seen their grewsome
    service, neck twisters, back breakers, and other
    such unhappy instruments of torture, which recall,
    all too vividly, perhaps, the days when they were
    wont to be put into actual and frequent use in that
    same tower. In the tower, too, they will show you
    some of the dark, musty old dungeons, used for the
    former incarceration of political prisoners. Their
    names, written in blood by many of the victims,
    can still be traced upon the walls. Here also is
    where, in 1672, Cornelius De Witt, falsely accused
    of plotting against the life of William <abbr title="3">III</abbr>, and his
    brother John, who had unwisely hastened to the
    tower to intercede in his behalf, were put to their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>horrible deaths by the gullible mob of citizens, who,
    believing in the guilt of Cornelius, had assembled in
    the neighborhood to make a demonstration against
    him. The remains of the brothers De Witt rest in
    the Nieuwe Kerk.</p>

    <p>The Willem’splein, a large square a hundred yards
    or less to the east of the Binnenhof, is the center of
    gravity of The Hague’s traffic and street railway
    service. From here you may take an electric car
    to almost any part of the city, and to the suburbs
    as well. In the center of the plein stands the bronze
    statue of William the Silent, done by Royer and
    erected in 1848, with the Prince’s motto, “Tranquil
    Amid Raging Billows,” inscribed in Latin on the
    pedestal.</p>

    <p>Facing the square on the west side stand the
    Colonial Offices and the Ministry of Justice, while
    just off the northwest corner is the Mauritshuis&mdash;the
    Louvre, the Corcoran Gallery, the Kaiser Friedrich’s
    Museum of The Hague. Built in the early half
    of the seventeenth century as a residence for the
    Dutch West India Company’s Governor of Brazil,
    it now shelters what is probably the most notable
    collection of paintings gathered under one roof in
    Holland, the gifts to the nation of the different
    <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">stadtholders</i>.</p>

    <p>The reputed gems of this collection are Rembrandt’s
    rather morbid of subject, but admirably
    executed, “School of Anatomy,” and a large animal
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>painting by Paul Potter, known as “The Bull,” in
    which Potter presents a collection of farm animals.
    Their owner, standing nearby, appears to be nearly
    as large as the bull, which is the central figure, and
    the bull, in turn, is just a shade smaller than the
    tree under which the owner stands. Taken individually,
    the animals are painted in a most marvelous
    manner, but with regard to composition I should
    think the accomplished Potter would rather have
    been known by his smaller animal pictures and his
    landscapes; eight of the best of the latter now
    hang in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. “The Bull”
    was carried off to the Louvre by the French at the
    time of the flight of the Dutch <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">stadtholder</i> in 1795,
    where it was awarded fourth place in point of value.
    Originally purchased in 1749 for something like
    $300, Napoleon restored it to the Dutch nation at
    a handsome profit for about $25,000.</p>

    <p>The Mauritshuis also contains masterpieces by
    Holbein, Jan Steen, Rubens, Van Dyke, Terburg,
    Vermeer, and other famous Dutch artists, together
    with a Madonna by Murillo and some interesting
    royal portraits by Velasquez.</p>

    <p>Backing upon the Mauritshuis is the picturesque
    Vyver, a broad sheet of water punctured here and
    there by the divings of ducks and swans. Near the
    center of its south side it reflects the walls and towers
    of the ancient Binnenhof, while on its north it is
    lined with many rows of trees.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
    <p>Not far from where the lofty spire of iron openwork
    of the Groote Kerk&mdash;the scene of the wedding
    ceremony of Wilhelmina and Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin
    on February 7, 1901&mdash;serves as a
    conspicuous landmark for strangers in the city, and
    facing a continuation of the busy Hoogstraat, rises
    the unimposing royal palace, from the front windows
    of which the Queen may look out upon an equestrian
    statue of the father of her country, William the
    Silent. It is a palace that gives the impression of
    having been built for comfort rather than ostentation,
    and when the Queen is not in residence you
    may obtain tickets of permission to be taken through
    by a servant, from a little tobacco store near by.</p>

    <p>None of the rooms of the palace is particularly
    striking as to decorations and furniture, save one,
    and that is about the most remarkable apartment of
    any palace on the continent. Floor, walls, and ceiling,
    it is one solid mass of the most exquisitely
    carved teakwood, given by the colony of Java as
    a wedding present to the Queen. You will wonder
    little that it took upwards of thirty-five men seven
    years to complete the job. There are gold and inlaid
    pieces of wonderful workmanship in the cabinets
    that border the walls&mdash;presents from the Javanese
    to the little Juliana&mdash;which add to the whole impression
    of unalloyed richness welded together in perfect
    taste, without so much as giving the hint of a “gingerbread”
    effect. In beautiful gardens at the rear
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>of the palace the Queen walks every morning with
    Juliana after <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</i> at eleven.</p>

    <p>Farther along to the northwest is the fashionable
    residence section of The Hague, with the Willem’s
    Park as its principal focus. In the center of this
    park, in an open space called the “Plein 1813,”
    rises a handsome national monument, unveiled in
    1869 to commemorate the restoration of Dutch independence
    by the expulsion of the French in 1813
    and the return of the pristine exile, Prince William
    Frederic of Orange, who landed at Scheveningen and
    ascended the throne of Holland as king. Not far
    from here and still to the northwest, is the finest
    modern picture gallery in Holland, the Mesdag Museum,
    presented to the State by the modern Dutch
    artist, H. W. Mesdag, and his wife, in 1903.</p>

    <p>The shopping district of The Hague comprises the
    Hoogstraat and its immediate vicinity, the Spuistraat
    and the Wegenstraat. The narrow Spuistraat is always
    the most congested. Like the Hoogstraat in
    Rotterdam and the Kalverstraat in Amsterdam, it is
    so thickly patronized from four-thirty, say, until
    dark that vehicular traffic through it is self-suspended
    for the sake of saving time; even the pitiless Hague
    bicyclist is compelled to dismount and push his wheel
    through it. At this late hour of the day the cafés
    are given over to the cordially inclined and the coffee
    drinkers, who fill their favorite rendezvous to the
    bursting point. As in Berlin, the Zoological Garden
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>at The Hague, with its café-concerts, is also a
    much frequented spot for recreation, but, unlike the
    Berlin garden, the less said about its zoology the
    better.</p>

    <p>The beautiful old forest called the Bosch, lying
    just to the east of The Hague, intersected with disused
    and, therefore, rather stagnant canals, is the
    Versailles of Holland, and the “House in the Wood”
    is its Trianon. But the Bosch is much more accessible
    to The Hague than Versailles is to Paris, for
    an electric car will take you there from the plein
    in fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>

    <p>Erected in 1645 by Prince Frederic Henry of
    Orange for his consort, the Princess Amalia of
    Solms, “The House in the Wood” latterly became
    famous as the seat of the international peace conference
    which the representatives of twenty-six different
    world powers held here in 1899. The conference
    convened in the so styled “Orange Room,” an octagonal
    hall lighted with a cupola, its walls and ceiling
    embellished with allegorical scenes from the life
    of Prince Frederic, done in oils by Dutch and Flemish
    artists. It is by far the most important apartment
    in the palace. The other rooms contain some wonderful
    Japanese embroideries, cabinets of elaborately
    and minutely carved ivories, rice paper tapestries,
    porcelains, and other exquisite objects of Oriental
    handcraft. It was here that the American historian,
    John Lothrop Motley, wrote a greater part of his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>“<cite class="plain">The Rise of the Dutch Republic</cite>” and a portrait
    of him hangs upon the wall of one of the rooms.</p>

    <p>A short distance to the north of the forest will
    be erected the much talked of Peace Palace for the
    International Court of Arbitration, toward the cost
    of which Mr. Carnegie has promised to contribute
    a million and a half.</p>

    <p>But two miles from The Hague lies Scheveningen&mdash;Holland’s
    most fashionable, most expensive, most
    diverting seaside resort&mdash;the Atlantic City of the
    Netherlands. It may be approached by divers
    means: by railway train, by electric car, by omnibus,
    or on foot. The two principal and most popular
    routes served by the electric cars from The Hague
    are the Old Way and the New. Both are tree
    shaded and attractive, but the more tree shaded and
    attractive is the Old Way. The clinkers with which
    the most of it is paved were put down as early as
    1666. Lined on the left with handsome summer residences
    and on the right with a pretty park, the Old
    Way to Scheveningen, with its geometric rows of
    stately trees, is undoubtedly the finest avenue in Holland.</p>

    <p>Scheveningen, besides being a watering place of
    many merits and numerous shortcomings, is a town
    of no mean importance as a fishing port. Its fleet
    numbers two hundred or more <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">pinken</i>, or small fishing
    boats, and their catch is sold at auction at the fishing
    harbor upon arrival, as at Ostend.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
    <p>The name of the place is a hard one for the
    English-speaking tourist to pronounce, but he will
    not be far wrong if, in his apparent eagerness to get
    there, he inquires of the genial head porter at the
    hotel in The Hague the number of the car line that
    will take him to “Shave agin.” He may slur over
    a syllable or two in the abbreviation, but the head
    porter will make due allowance for at least a brave
    attempt to master the word&mdash;which is something&mdash;and
    will direct him accordingly.</p>

    <p>Instead of the old familiar seaside board walk,
    Scheveningen has its stone paved Boulevard, a mile
    and a quarter long and eighty feet wide. This is
    the promenade of the international hodgepodge of
    holiday makers, augmented on a Sunday and in the
    evenings by giggling girls and sober countenanced
    fishermen from the village. Invariably dressed in
    their best Sunday-go-to-meetings, the most conspicuous
    feature of the feminine attire is a wide shawl,
    often suggesting the Persian in design, worn tight
    about the shoulders and reaching down to the waist
    in the back. Of course the skirts are padded voluminously
    about the hips, and the girls display at the
    temples many varieties of gilded antennæ to hold
    their white caps securely.</p>

    <p>About midway of the Boulevard and back of it,
    stands the ever present Kurhaus, although what they
    profess to cure in that house may simply be a reluctance
    on the part of the holder to diminish his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>letter of credit. It is three hundred feet or more in
    length, this Kurhaus, and its commodious hall, in
    which are held some very excellent symphony orchestra
    concerts, can seat as many as 3,000 people. On
    the side of the Kurhaus overlooking the sea there is
    a large stone terrace where the band plays in the
    afternoons, and, underneath this, a very expensive
    café.</p>

    <p>Just opposite the Kurhaus is the pier&mdash;a real old-fashioned
    ocean going steel pier, terminating in a
    concert pavilion and built right out into the water
    for almost a quarter of a mile, having a plate glass
    partition down the middle, so that there is a lee and
    a weather side to it. At intervals along its sides
    are fish nets, which may be raised from or lowered
    into the water by means of a crank and spindle
    attached to the pier railing. These are rented to
    the public on the time basis, and there is ever a
    group of persistent people vibrating between one net
    and another in the hope that its operator may bring
    to the rail a real denizen of the watery depths. I
    contracted the fever one day myself and fell in with
    this flitting crowd for an hour, more or less, only
    to be unrewarded in the end, but I am told that if
    anything piscatorially larger than an adult white-bait
    inadvertently becomes enmeshed in any of the
    nets and is brought to the surface the successful
    fisher receives round after round of enthusiastic
    applause.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
    <p>And Scheveningen is in no sense of the word a
    philanthropic institution. Everything in the place
    has its price mark tagged securely on. You have to
    pay to walk on the pier, concert or no concert; you
    have to pay to listen to the band from the Kurhaus
    terrace; you have to pay to sit in one of the yellow
    mushroom chairs that make the beach resemble a
    fungus growth; you have to pay even to take a bath
    in the ocean, and are then restricted to the hours
    of from seven in the morning until sunset. On Sundays
    they close up the ocean for bathing purposes at
    2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

    <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="" width="631" height="390" />
    <p class="center">The Kurhaus at Scheveningen, Holland’s most expensive,
    most fashionable and most diverting seaside resort</p>
    </div>

    <p>But sea bathing is a different proposition in Europe
    from what it is in America. At Scheveningen it
    is a matter of the most serious import, and the necessities
    for its success&mdash;I almost said “enjoyment”&mdash;are
    many. To go about it in the proper manner,
    you first approach the ticket window on the Boulevard
    in front of the Kurhaus and apply to the
    cashier for a permit, varying in price according to
    the class of bath selected. Providing you have
    brought your own bathing suit, this will be the only
    payment necessary, for the permit graciously entitles
    you to the use of two towels, obviously for drying
    purposes. In case you have come unprepared with
    regard to bathing apparel, you will have to pay for
    a suit, although, judging from those I have seen
    personally, the wearer should be the one to be rewarded.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>To avail yourself of the use of a “bath-sheet”&mdash;whatever
    that may be&mdash;necessitates additional
    expenditure, and there are various other alleged
    indispensable articles that the cashier may try to
    inflict upon the unwary at face value.</p>

    <p>The next step is to repair to the beach and await
    the calling out of the number shown on your ticket,
    whereupon you are assigned to a striped kind of house
    on wheels, of the same kith and kin as an English
    “caravan” wagon. In this you must wait until
    the attendant sees fit to hitch his horse to it and
    haul you, wagon and all, into the surf. During the
    voyage you will have finished changing your costume
    and the minute your wagon is backed into the water
    you are ready to commence your amphibious performance.
    A high sign to the attendant will be the
    signal that you have survived the operation of bathing,
    and, presto! his horse will haul you out upon
    dry land again.</p>

    <p>Doubtless on account of the expenses incurred in
    taking the proper precautions for bathing there are
    more waders at Scheveningen, especially among the
    thrifty Dutch, than there are bathers. Human snipe,
    ducks, and storks, according to their respective
    builds, with trousers rolled to their knees or petticoats
    pinned up to a similar altitude, daily patrol
    the edge of the ocean for a mile or more.</p>

    <p>Surf riding is another favorite method of spending
    a half hour’s time at Scheveningen, the game being
    to suffer oneself to be bobbed up and down at the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>mercy of the breakers in a tethered fishing boat, only
    to be ultimately carried ashore again on the backs
    of the crew.</p>

    <p>An obelisk at the southern end of the Boulevard
    commemorates the landing of Prince William Frederic
    of Orange, but the victorious naval achievement of
    Admiral de Ruyter in defeating the combined French
    and English fleets off the coast of Scheveningen in
    1673, remains unhonored.</p>

    <span class="chap_name">Leyden and Haarlem</span></h2>


    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">If</span> you happen to have penetrated Holland as far
    as The Hague without having availed yourself
    of the steam tram method of conveyance between
    one town and another the trip by this means from
    The Hague to Leyden might be suggested as an
    excellent one with which to commence to develop
    the habit.</p>

    <p>The tram that operates on regular schedule between
    the Schenkweg in The Hague and the Groote
    Ryndyk in Leyden pierces a delightful country checkered
    by a labyrinth of canals, long and short, wide
    and narrow. Even every patch of humble cabbages
    appears to be surrounded with one, along which the
    truck gardeners pole their boats that bear the vegetables
    direct from soil to market. Tree crested dikes,
    straight as the shortest distance between two points,
    stretch away into the perspective in every direction.
    Villas and cozy country cottages come quickly into
    view and fade away again behind their groves of
    trees, giving the traveler just a flitting suggestion
    of the comfort their owners must find in them. In
    passing through the neat little brick-paved villages
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>of Voorburg and Voorschoten the tram engine careens
    around through the streets as if it had developed a
    first-class state of intoxication. It aims directly for
    a kitchen door here and the walls of a church there,
    only to miss them by a few feet while making a dexterous
    turn to the other side of the road, twisting its
    diminutive train of two or three cars in its wake.
    Then out beside the dikes again it puffs and sputters
    on its seemingly remonstrative way to Leyden.</p>

    <p>Leyden is a quiet, curious old town, rich in history
    and effervescent with learning. With due respect to
    art, it was the birthplace of a dozen or more of the
    most illustrious Dutch painters of the sixteenth and
    seventeenth centuries, including Jan Steen, Gerard
    Dou, and last, but by no means least, the celebrated
    Rembrandt; but, strange to tell, it cannot boast of
    a single masterpiece of any of them. At its university,
    then renowned throughout the world, the future
    savants of the age came to pore over their books.
    Hugo Grotius was one of its earlier sons, and later,
    in 1755, at the age of twenty-seven, Oliver Goldsmith
    aspired in vain to the degree of Doctor of
    Medicine, afterwards conferred at Louwain, giving
    Leyden the first opportunity of being its donor.
    The town’s many museums&mdash;of ethnography, of natural
    history, of comparative anatomy, of physiology,
    of archeology&mdash;bespeak its hobby: the insatiable
    thirst for knowledge. Even many of the signs one
    reads in the town are in Latin.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_092.jpg" alt="" width="596" height="400" />
    <p class="center">An excellent way to go from The Hague to Leyden is by
    steam tram, the curious engine of which is shown here</p>
    </div>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
    <p>Four hundred years ago Leyden could brag about
    its 100,000 population without treading on the toes
    of any city in Holland. To-day it contains little
    more than half as many souls as it did then. Since
    its “revision downward” from its pinnacle at the top
    of the Dutch textile industry, it has seemed a sacrilege
    to conduct business in the place. Its university
    sustained for a time the reputation that its weaving
    enterprises relinquished, but now we go to Vienna,
    instead of to Leyden, to glean the fine points in the
    science of medicine. Using Discovery for a fulcrum,
    Time undermines methods with the infallibility of the
    sun’s attraction, and brands them as obsolete forever.</p>

    <p>The historical bench mark of Leyden is the siege
    it survived at the point of the Spanish bayonet in
    the sixteenth century. Lasting, in the aggregate,
    from October 31, 1573, until October 3, 1574,
    this siege may be considered as one of the longest
    and most persistent in the annals of history, and its
    ultimate relief was as characteristic, picturesque, and
    ingenious as if it had been the plot of a tale by
    Dumas.</p>

    <p>At the expense of the lives of 4,000 patriots, himself
    included, Count Louis of Nassau effected a partial
    relief of Leyden five months after the siege
    commenced; but, encouraged by the butchery of this
    Dutch commander and his comparative handful of
    soldiers, the Spaniards continued to hold on so tenaciously
    that William the Silent concocted the daring
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>scheme to flood the intervening country with water
    from the sea so that his fleet might sail in to the
    rescue.</p>

    <p>Having already reduced Leyden to the point of
    starvation, Valdez, the Spanish general, in glowing
    phrases offered pardon to the citizens if they would
    but open the gates of the beleaguered city and surrender.
    But the people would have none of it, placing
    renewed confidences in their leader, William of
    Orange, and consoling themselves as best they could
    with the firm belief that he was listening to their
    prayers and would ultimately devise some means of
    raising the blockade.</p>

    <p>As time dragged wearily on, the sorties of the
    Dutch became less frequent and, finally, it was announced
    by the din of clanging church bells that the
    gates should henceforth be kept closed and no man
    should venture outside the city.</p>

    <p>Even at this time, William, unbeknown to the
    people of Leyden, was appealing to the States to
    allow him to open the flood gates of Rotterdam and
    Schiedam and to pierce the dikes along the Meuse
    and the Yssel in order to inundate the country and
    give his fleet a fairway to the very watchtowers of
    Leyden. After much debate, his proposition for
    effecting the relief, although a most destructive one
    to the surrounding country, was accepted; bonds
    were issued by the States to help defray the expenses
    of the task, and patriotic Dutch housewives disposed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>of silver plate and jewelry as their contributions to
    the financial furtherance of the scheme.</p>

    <p>It was not until some days after the Prince had
    supervised in person the unlocking of the gates at
    Schiedam and Rotterdam on August 3rd and the
    rupture of the dikes at sixteen different places along
    the Yssel, that the starving prisoners of Leyden commenced
    to grow impatient and appealed by letter to
    Orange, telling him that their bread was gone and
    that the supply of its only substitute, malt cakes,
    would last but four days longer. To their letters the
    Prince, having unfortunately and most untimely contracted
    the fever, answered reassuringly from his
    sick bed in Rotterdam to the effect that the dikes
    had been cut, that water was already pouring in
    over the land, and that as soon as its depth was
    sufficient to float the fleet an attempt at rescue would
    be made. The message was read by the Burgomaster,
    Van der Werf, to the people assembled in the
    market place, and the welcome news was received with
    great rejoicings.</p>

    <p>Although the water about Leyden had by this time
    reached a depth of ten inches, the Spaniards, at first
    confused, later became confident that the thing could
    not be accomplished. When, from the lack of a
    breeze, the water failed to rise higher; and because
    of the inability of the prostrate Prince, which neither
    the besiegers nor besieged had heard of nor even
    imagined, curtailed additional attempts to flood the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>country; the Spaniards began to taunt the valiant
    citizens. “Go up to the tower, ye Beggars,” they
    cried, “go up to the tower and tell us if ye can see
    the ocean coming over the dry land to your relief.”</p>

    <p>But the citizens did go up to the tower, and, after
    bravely having withstood the siege until early in
    September, by which time a gale of wind had risen
    and the Prince had recovered in a measure from his
    illness, they did see the ocean coming over the dry
    land to their relief, and with a vengeance. Not only
    that, but they also saw a welcome fleet of two hundred
    vessels coming in on the crest of the ocean;
    they saw this fleet come up from the south, steadily
    and undisputed, to within five miles of Leyden; they
    saw it demolish the Spanish forts&mdash;a navy of surgeons
    cauterizing the festering sores on the face of
    fair Holland. Then, to their consternation, they
    saw the gale die out and the waters recede, leaving
    the entire fleet stranded at North Aa, just beyond
    cannon’s shot of its goal.</p>

    <p>Despair took the place of hope in the hearts of the
    besieged. They implored, and then threatened the
    life of Burgomaster Van der Werf if he refused to
    surrender to the Spaniards. He came out into the
    little square just opposite the old church of St.
    Pancras, waved his felt hat as a signal for silence,
    and delivered himself of a short but pithy address
    that turned despair into faith, animosity into pride,
    and fired the hearts of his countrymen with renewed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>patriotism. What he said on that occasion has gone
    down in history as one of the most superb proclamations
    ever uttered by a brave man for a national
    cause.</p>

    <p>“What would ye, my friends?” he said. “Why
    do ye murmur that we do not break our vows and
    surrender the city to the Spaniards?&mdash;a fate more
    horrible than the agony which she now endures. I
    tell you that I have made an oath to hold the city,
    and may God give me strength to keep my oath!
    I can die but once; whether by your hands, the
    enemy’s, or by the hand of God. My own fate is
    indifferent to me. Not so that of the city intrusted
    to my care. I know that we shall starve if not soon
    relieved; but starvation is preferable to the dishonored
    fate which is the only alternative. Your
    menaces move me not. My life is at your disposal.
    Here is my sword; plunge it into my breast and
    divide my flesh among you. Take my body to appease
    your hunger, but expect no surrender so long
    as I remain alive.”</p>

    <p>How the populace of Leyden, after listening to
    this, rushed to the ramparts with renewed courage
    engendered within them and hurled defiance in the
    teeth of the bloodthirsty Spaniards; how as many
    as 8,000 died in the streets from the plague alone,
    germinated by the foulness of the beleaguered city;
    how the frantic people stripped even the leaves from
    the trees to relieve their hunger and fought over the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>garbage pits for every possible morsel of food; how
    at last a violent equinoctial gale on the first two
    days of October filled the lowland with water and
    floated the stranded fleet; how this fleet sailed in
    between the trees and the chimney pots of submerged
    farmhouses, putting the Spaniards to flight as it
    advanced; and how, on the morning of the 3rd of
    October, the Dutch ships, under Admiral Boisot,
    paddled up the canals of Leyden while the stricken
    citizens gathered on the banks and tried to shout
    with wild delight, but could not on account of their
    emaciated condition&mdash;are all matters of historical
    fact that may be perused in detail in the pages of
    any authoritative work on the rise of the Dutch
    Republic.</p>

    <p>It is also an historical fact that on the very next
    day after the relief of Leyden the gale shifted and
    blew with all its fury from the northeast, driving out
    the waters before it, so that within a few days the
    country was as it had been before and the labor of
    repairing the dikes commenced forthwith.</p>

    <p>As a reward for the sufferings of the people of
    Leyden the city was granted an annual fair of ten
    days with exemption from taxes and the States caused
    the university to be established.</p>

    <p>The University of Leyden doesn’t look much like
    our idea of a university, for the professors, except
    those in the department of medicine, teach their
    classes at home, the nine hundred students live in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>town, and, as a result, dormitories and classrooms
    are things that may be dispensed with. The old
    “university building,” however, originally a nunnery,
    maintains in its connection one of the finest libraries
    in Holland.</p>

    <p>Not far from where the lofty perpendicular Gothic
    windows of the church of St. Pancras overlook the
    square in which the Burgomaster extemporized with
    such eloquence at the time of the siege, a shipload of
    gunpowder exploded in 1807. After removing the
    débris of the buildings which it razed, the Leydeners
    planted the site as a public park and erected a statue
    of the valiant Van der Werf in the center of it.
    Backed by two or three handsome new buildings belonging
    to the university and facing a wide, clear
    canal, this Van der Werf Park vies with the Botanical
    Gardens behind the old university building, as
    peaceful a spot in which to spend a moonlit evening
    pondering over the history of the old place as may
    be found in Leyden; while from the Morsch Gate,
    a well preserved remnant of earlier fortifications,
    many temptingly shaded walks twist and twine
    through the immediate neighborhood.</p>

    <p>In Leyden, and not in Amsterdam or Rotterdam,
    as one might suppose, I came across a beggar for
    the first time in Holland, although technically, he
    came across me. The atmosphere of book learning
    was probably what launched him on his career, for
    he certainly seemed able-bodied enough to make a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>more honest living by the sweat of his brow; but
    the people of Leyden are not given much to fluent
    perspiration. And it might be here mentioned that
    one of the reliefs of travel in Holland, compared with
    Italy, for example, is its dearth of mendicants and
    beggars. Cripples and the poverty stricken are to
    be found in Holland as in any other country, but, as
    a rule, they do not submit their complaints to the
    sympathies of the tourist. Wherever possible, one
    of Holland’s world famed charitable institutions gets
    hold of them and sends them from the congested city
    to the pauper colony in the country. Three such
    colonies, founded in 1817, are situated near the railway
    line from Meppel to Leeuwarden, while in the
    one city of Amsterdam there are more than a hundred
    benevolent institutions. The Society for the Public
    Welfare, or, in Dutch, <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Maatschappij tot Nut van’t
    Algemeen</i>, with headquarters in Amsterdam, was
    founded in 1784 and has made its influence felt
    throughout the entire kingdom.</p>

    <p>Katwyk and Noordwyk, three miles apart, the particular
    seashore resorts that cater especially to the
    people of Leyden and Haarlem, are both connected
    by steam tram with Leyden. Both are insignificant
    and expensive, and neither is so attractive as Domburg
    nor so gay as Scheveningen. Their wide beaches
    of fine sand would seem to us their only assets.</p>

    <p>But if you would have further evidence of the
    Dutch mastery of the element of water, take the tram
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>to Katwyk aan Zee and walk up the beach a half
    mile or more to where they have harnessed the mouth
    of the old Rhine and curbed its outlet to suit their
    convenience.</p>

    <p>A hurricane having thrown up the sand before the
    mouth of the river in the year 839, thus causing its
    flow into the ocean to be blocked, its backed-up waters
    created a swamp which all but covered the entire
    territory known as Rynland, and which, in the subsequent
    diversion of the river’s course, was largely
    responsible for the formation of the vast delta in the
    south. In 1807 the Dutch conceived the project of
    draining this swamp and making <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">polders</i> of it by
    pumping its water into especially constructed canals.
    Later they relieved the congestion of sand at the
    old Rhine’s mouth and built a series of flood gates
    across it. By closing these gates at high tide they
    were enabled to exclude the inrush of water from the
    ocean, and by opening them again at low tide, they
    permitted the accumulated waters of the river to
    flow out into the ocean at the rate of 50,000 cubic
    feet per minute. Thus was the Haarlemerpolder,
    seventy-two square miles in extent, reclaimed from
    what used to be the Haarlemermeer.</p>

    <p>The tram line from Leyden to Katwyk passes first
    through the village of Endegeest, the home and workshop
    of Descartes for a number of years, and then
    through Rynsburg, the former residence of that
    grandfather of modern philosophy, Spinoza, born of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>Jewish parents in Amsterdam in 1632. The little
    places are so shady, so peaceful, so still, that anyone
    having been brought up within their solitudes might
    very naturally develop the pastime of philosophizing
    without half trying.</p>

    <p>The latter part of April or the first part of May
    is the proper time of year to visit Haarlem and its
    vicinity. Then the tulips, crocuses, lilies, and hyacinths
    are in the halcyon days of their bloom, swaying
    languidly to and fro in the gentle breeze and
    diffusing a delicious perfume that is wafted over the
    country for miles. Fields and fields of them there
    are&mdash;a sweetly scented “crazy quilt” of superlative
    sheen and luster; for Haarlem, the greatest flower
    garden in the world, exports bulbs of all varieties to
    every civilized country.</p>

    <p>Whether the Dutch or the Portuguese became the
    first European tulip fanciers is a moot question. The
    flower originally came from the East, its name being
    derived from the Persian <i lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">toliban</i>, or turban. Suffice
    it to say that by 1636 bulb culture in general and
    tulip culture in particular had developed into a veritable
    mania in and about Haarlem. Bulbs became
    then as much an item of speculation as shares of
    mining stock are at the present day&mdash;and just as
    uncertain. Fortunes were made and lost in the open
    market. Generally speaking, everybody in Haarlem,
    whether or not he professed to be anything of a
    floriculturist, dickered through the brokers in bulbs.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>One speculator in Amsterdam netted almost $35,000
    in four months. Prices went up steadily until, at the
    height of the boom, the bulb of a “Viceroy” brought
    $2,000, an “Admiral Liefkens” slightly more, and
    a “Semper Augustus” was sold for $6,000.</p>

    <p>Then came the panic. The bottom dropped out
    of the bucket of bulbs. The government forbade
    the gambling, and between suns the price of an offshoot
    of the “Semper Augustus” dropped to fifty
    florins, or approximately twenty-two dollars.</p>

    <p>After a century of quiet, somebody started a short-lived
    palpitation in hyacinths, but the highest price
    paid for a single hyacinth bulb was not more than
    $800.</p>

    <p>To-day the Dutch make more of a serious business
    of bulb raising, and the rather inconspicuous offshoot
    has become a recognized article of trade and
    commerce. Almost all of the 2,000 Dutch varieties
    of tulips have been developed by patient and thoughtful
    culture from the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Tulipa Gesneriana</i>, which Conrad
    Gesner purchased in Constantinople and brought
    to Augsburg in Germany in 1559.</p>

    <p>In Holland the tulip is propagated both from the
    seed and from the offshoots of the bulb. The offshoots
    may be expected to reproduce their true variety
    as to colorings and markings, growing to a flowering
    size in three or four years. Seedlings, on the
    other hand, are less vain and more reticent. No
    matter what the complexions of their parents might
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>have been, the first flowers of a seedling, appearing
    after it has had four or five years’ growth, are of
    a single color. A tulip in such a state is called a
    “breeder,” and remains so until, after several years,
    its flower suddenly “breaks” into the gorgeous colors
    of the “flamed” or the “feathered” tulip. It is then
    classified according to color and variety and placed
    upon the market. To hasten this period of “breaking”
    in the career of the tulip&mdash;for no man can
    compute with any degree of certainty the year in
    which it will take place&mdash;the growers resort to various
    means, even sending the bulbs away sometimes
    for a change of climate. “Breeders” that have
    taken on the desired markings and colors are said
    to have become “rectified.” But the problem of
    chance that the seedling tulips will “break” into
    a new variety is one that the Dutch have been pondering
    over for centuries, and, as has already been
    said, they have been rewarded to the extent of 2,000
    varieties. Much care is devoted to the preparation
    of the soil and, after fertilizing thoroughly, the
    grower will first plant it with potatoes for a couple
    of years in order to diminish its strength and adapt
    it better to the cultivation of tulips. The bulbs are
    taken up each summer, their offshoots detached, and
    then replaced in fresh soil.</p>

    <p class="center">Inside the Groote Kerk in Haarlem, showing its organ,
    which was long considered one of the greatest in the world</p>
    </div>

    <p>The year before the siege of Leyden, Haarlem
    suffered a siege under Frederic of Toledo, the son
    of the Spaniard, Alva; but Haarlem was not so
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>fortunate as her sister city. After bravely maintaining
    the place against the enemy for a period of seven
    weary months, with odds of seven to one against
    them, the Prince of Orange, with heavy heart, sent a
    message asking the commandant to make the best
    terms he would with the Spaniards and surrender,
    the many attempts of the Prince to rescue the city
    having proved futile.</p>

    <p>The massacre that followed the surrender was too
    shocking to bear the telling of in detail. The garrison
    and its commandant, the Protestant clergy, and
    2,000 or more burghers were cruelly butchered by
    the Spaniards. Alva himself, however, was forced
    to admit to Philip that “never was a place defended
    with such skill and bravery as Haarlem”; not only
    the men of the town, little accustomed to arms, but
    the women also had taken an active part in Haarlem’s
    defense, and Kenau Hasselaer, “a widow of distinguished
    family and unblemished reputation, about
    forty-seven years of age, who, at the head of her
    amazons” (some three hundred or more) “participated
    in many of the most fiercely contested actions
    of the siege, both within and without the walls.”</p>

    <p>As the birthplace of a number of Holland’s celebrated
    painters, including Franz Hals and Jacob van
    Ruysdael, Haarlem holds as her most cherished possession
    a handsome percentage of the works of the
    former, numbering among which are his ten famous
    corporation and regent canvases, arranged in chronological
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>order in the museum of the old Town Hall.
    To know these will mean that you know the jovial
    Franz.</p>

    <p>Across the market place from the Town Hall
    rises the Groote Kerk, and, just beside it, the old
    meat market, erected in 1602, and said, by those
    who know, to be the quaintest brick and stone Renaissance
    building in the Netherlands. The Groote Kerk
    is of a graceful cruciform shape and around the edges
    of its buttresses, like chicks peeping from under the
    protecting wings of the mother hen, are built a
    number of curious little one-story houses whose interiors
    suggest the last word in coziness and cleanliness,
    and where the much maligned Dutch decorative
    taste may be seen at its best. The church contains
    what was long considered the largest and loudest pipe
    organ in the world, possessing three keyboards, sixty
    stops, and 5,000 pipes of varying lengths and diameters
    up to thirty-two feet in the case of the former
    and fifteen inches with respect to the latter. A cannon
    ball, imbedded in the wall of the south aisle of the
    church, was allowed to remain undisturbed during
    the restoration as a reminiscence of the siege of 1572.</p>

    <p>At the side of the church, in the market place,
    stands a bronze statue of a Dutchman of the name
    of Coster, erected in 1856 upon rather fictitious evidence
    of his having been the inventor of printing.
    Nothing in the way of printed matter having been
    proven to have been done by Coster prior to or even
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>shortly after 1447, when Gutenburg of Mayence
    developed the art, the palm for this distinction was
    finally, but reluctantly, relegated to the latter.</p>

    <p>Instead of Spanish encampments, Haarlem is now
    surrounded with a beautiful forest, a prominent collection
    of attractive residences, municipal playgrounds
    for the children, and lives in an atmosphere
    of peace and comfort. The old Amsterdam Gate
    at the east end of the city serves as the only reminder
    that the place at one time possessed strong fortifications.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">From</span> all practical points of view, if, indeed, it
    is stretching the metaphor a bit with regard
    to smells and scenes (to preserve the alliteration),
    Amsterdam may be considered the Venice of
    the Netherlands. Like Venice it seems to have as
    many canals as there are blood vessels in the human
    body; like Venice it is the home of the damp cellar,
    for the city is built upon piles.</p>

    <p>In the erection of a new building in Amsterdam
    the first thing they do is to pump out the site, and,
    after they have it fairly dry, keep on pumping to
    prevent it from filling up again; when the structure
    is completed they celebrate the event by the installation
    of a permanent pump in the basement which
    they must needs start running at stated intervals
    to diminish the volume of water that has seeped in
    through the cracks. The driver of piles takes the
    place of our stone mason, for of piles is the city’s
    foundation. A foot at a whack, these piles are sunk
    into the sand. They are then morticed with mud,
    girders are strung between them, and behold! the
    house on stilts commences to assume its architectural
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>design. By and by the mud loses its adhesive properties
    to a certain degree, and the building commences
    to lean dangerously forward or backward, although
    without the dire results that one might imagine.</p>

    <p>Amsterdam is the largest and most commercially
    important city in Holland. Founded in 1204 by
    Gysbrecht <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, who built a castle here, and choked the
    flow of the river Amstel by throwing a dam across it&mdash;from
    which more or less momentous event the town
    derived its appellation,&mdash;Florins <abbr title="5">V</abbr>, of Binnenhof
    fame, favored the place to the extent of granting its
    exemption from the taxes imposed by Zeeland and
    Holland. In 1311 it was formally absorbed by the
    latter province. From that time on Amsterdam gathered
    greater importance as a commercial center, until,
    in the early years of the seventeenth century, after
    the Dutch had finally succeeded in beating off the
    Spaniards, the establishment of the Dutch East India
    Company added its might to raise Amsterdam to
    the rank of the foremost mercantile community in
    the world. Later she commenced to gravitate slowly
    down the incline of trade and her cogs refused to
    take hold again until the latter half of the nineteenth
    century, although at the time of the dividing of
    the Dutch Republic, when King Louis Bonaparte
    took up his residence in Amsterdam in 1808, she was
    considered the third greatest city in the French Empire.
    To-day she has advanced well past the half
    million population mark. Although as regards her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>foreign trade she does not profess to compete with
    Rotterdam, as a money market and clearing house
    for colonial products she is preëminent in the
    Netherlands.</p>

    <p>The Dam&mdash;a large square that owes its name to
    the fact of its being the eastern boundary of Lord
    Amstel’s embankment across the river&mdash;is the axis
    around which Amsterdam revolves. It is literally
    the hub of the Dutch universe. Every electric car
    in the place starts from the Dam, and in due course
    of time will wind its way back again. The principal
    edifices adjacent to it are the Royal Palace, the
    Nieuwe Kerk, or New Church, and the imposing post
    and telegraph offices.</p>

    <p>Completed in the year 1655 at a total cost of
    more than $3,000,000, this Royal Palace was originally
    the Town Hall, but when Louis Bonaparte
    came upon the scene the Dutch made him a present
    of it for his use as a royal residence. At a later
    date King William <abbr title="1">I</abbr> of Holland handed it back to
    the city, whose property it still remains, instead of
    that of the Crown; so that when Wilhelmina makes
    her annual ten days’ visit to Amsterdam she comes
    more as a private citizen and is the guest of the city
    for the period of her stay. With its 264 feet of
    length and its 207 of width it seems rather a strain
    upon the imagination to picture the Royal Palace
    as standing upon stilts; but such is actually the case,
    for its foundations consist of 13,659 piles (to be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>absolutely accurate) driven from forty to sixty feet
    into the sand.</p>

    <p>The difference in ages between the Nieuwe Kerk,
    just around the corner from the palace, and the
    Oude Kerk, or Old Church of Amsterdam, is that
    the Oude Kerk was erected in 1300, whereas they
    didn’t commence work upon the Nieuwe Kerk until
    a hundred and eight years later. Both were doing
    their religious duties before America was discovered.
    Successive conflagrations destroyed different parts
    of the Nieuwe Kerk and the first service in the building
    as it stands to-day was not celebrated until 1648.
    The church contains the tombs of three of Holland’s
    famous fighting admirals, that of Admiral de Ruyter
    included, in addition to the hermes bust of another,
    and the mausoleum of a Dutch lieutenant of marines,
    van Speyk by name, who, during the revolution of
    Holland, “maintained on the 5th of February, 1831,
    before Antwerp, the honor of his native flag at the
    cost of his life” by blowing up his gunboat in the
    harbor of Antwerp to prevent it from falling into
    the possession of the enemy. Since 1814 four kings
    of Holland have taken the oath of the constitution
    in the Nieuwe Kerk and here, on September 6,
    1898, Wilhelmina was formally inaugurated Queen
    of the Netherlands&mdash;an event recently commemorated
    by the installation of a handsome stained glass window
    in the church. Well might the Nieuwe Kerk be
    said to be the Westminster Abbey of Amsterdam.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>Connecting the Dam with the central railway station
    is the wide Damrak, part of which was at one
    time a canal. In the opposite direction wiggles the
    narrow Kalverstraat, Amsterdam’s principal shopping
    street, thronged in the late afternoon and evening
    with that part of the population of the city that
    isn’t sipping coffee in the windows of its cafés.</p>

    <p>Once I had the misfortune to be stopping in Amsterdam
    upon the occasion of the Queen’s birthday,
    the 31st of August. This not being sufficient
    unpremeditated self-punishment, I was provincial
    enough to have chosen as headquarters what appeared
    from across the street to be a clean, quiet little
    hotel in the Kalverstraat. The two blended most
    harmoniously. Between the unmelodious patriots
    who paraded the Kalverstraat from sunset to sunrise,
    and the battles royal participated in with the
    ambidextrous entomological specimens among the bedclothes,
    I did anything but enjoy a refreshing night’s
    rest. To which tale there are two morals: avoid
    Amsterdam on the Queen’s birthday, and little Juliana’s
    as well, and eschew the hotels in the Kalverstraat
    (one especially, which shall be nameless) as
    you would the nest of the subtle hornet.</p>

    <p>At the southeastern terminus of the Kalverstraat
    stands the old Mint Tower of 1620, and still farther
    to the east is the Rembrandtplein, a small, park-centered
    intersection of streets named in honor of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>Holland’s painter <i>par excellence</i>, who lived for sixteen
    years at No. 4 Joden-Breestraat in Amsterdam’s
    Jewish quarter, the house having been since
    marked with a small memorial tablet.</p>

    <p>Here bordering the Rembrandtplein are the larger
    sidewalk cafés, jammed of a summer’s evening with
    pleasure-seeking Amsterdamers, each with a cup or
    a glass of something in front of him. Like those
    found in the ordinary German cafés these crowds
    seldom change. Here you may find the same people
    at eleven that you have seen at seven, and in exactly
    the same positions. A cup of coffee followed by a
    cordial is the usual evening’s refreshment programme,
    the consuming time of which the Amsterdamer
    will expand into a couple of hours by the assiduous
    perusal of every newspaper and periodical he can
    inveigle the waiter to bring him, interrupted only
    by an occasional sip of his beverage. Even the persistent
    street singers, who come one at a time to
    prolong the agony and stand but a few feet away
    from his table, yelling triumphantly into his ear, fail
    to disturb him in the least. If, unthinkingly, he
    finishes his refreshment before he considers the time
    has arrived to go home to bed, he will calmly smoke
    out the remainder of the engagement. The expenditure
    of half a <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gulden</i> or less will buy his contentment
    until the following evening.</p>

    <p>Many of the indoor cafés charge a small admission
    fee for the privilege of listening to a “lady orchestra.”
    In each of these that part which is adjacent
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>to the street will be partitioned off by a dark curtain,
    so that the patrons of the place may choose, if there
    be any choice, between the crowds on the street and
    the vaudeville turns that may be scheduled to follow
    the sufferings of the musicians.</p>

    <p>On the Rembrandtplein stands also the Rembrandt
    theater, Amsterdam’s principal playhouse,
    which, by way of information, is closed in summer.
    But, by way of further information, there are in
    the city a number of vaudeville theaters that cater
    to the less exacting in the matter of histrionic art
    and are open throughout the year, offering more
    or less respectable performances.</p>

    <p>To one of these near the Rembrandtplein I
    wended my way upon a certain evening, desirous of
    being amused, no matter what the consequences. I
    obtained my money’s worth, and more. It cost me
    one and a half <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gulden</i> to get in, and it might have
    cost me an ear, or other projecting appendage, to
    get out if I had not slipped through a side exit as
    inconspicuously as I could during the height of the
    mêlée and commenced forthwith to accelerate my
    gait toward the hotel. I think the disturbance was
    inaugurated by an American protégé of His Pugilistic
    Highness, John Johnson, but I did not consider
    it exactly safe at the time to tarry longer in order
    to ascertain definitely.</p>

    <p>It so happened that this particular vaudeville
    house was in the habit of concluding its performance
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>each evening with a series of international wrestling
    matches, offering a considerable monetary reward
    to the winner of the finals. The first bout of the
    evening of my visit was between an Englishman and
    a Dutchman, which terminated satisfactorily for the
    latter and with no casualties. The crowd went rampant;
    whereupon I became imbued with the spirit of
    the thing, ordered another cup of coffee&mdash;which, by
    the way, was served gratis by the management&mdash;and
    settled myself more comfortably to enjoy the next
    tilt between a Frenchman and a Swede. The gougings
    and hair-pullings resorted to by the Latin
    were not received with complacency on the part of
    the audience, and when he lost the match, he made
    his exit with ruffled temper, together with his full
    share of hisses and catcalls. Then the promoters
    of the scheme made a managerial mistake. They
    pitted a bloated Belgian wrestler against the champion
    of Amsterdam. A brief reference to the pages
    of any volume reciting the incidents of 1830–31 will
    convey the correct impression that the Belgians and
    the Dutch are not the intimate playmates they used
    to be&mdash;a fact which in itself precluded the possibility
    of any amicable settlement of the forthcoming athletic
    imbroglio.</p>

    <p>The Belgian proved to be a past master in the
    science of hair-pulling and eye-gouging. When the
    even tempered Dutchman finally turned him on his
    back he felt called upon to challenge the referee, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>score keeper, the orchestra, the audience, or any other
    single individual or group of them that happened
    to be within reach. The crowd hooted the villain and
    applauded the hero.</p>

    <p>Just at this inopportune moment a dark, ominous
    cloud, of African parentage, wrapped in a true Alabama
    grin and peg-top trousers, blew in from the
    wings and commenced to congratulate the victor
    hilariously. In order that the peace respecting reputation
    of the house might be preserved, a brigade of
    stage hands and ushers rushed in double phalanx upon
    the scene, and, with rather generous turn of mind,
    attempted to distract the negro’s attention and keep
    him from maiming the Belgian. Ultimately they
    tried to put the negro out&mdash;an inconsiderate procedure,
    to say the least. I once saw the same thing
    attempted during fair week in Albuquerque, to the
    demolition of several plate glass windows and the
    necessary services of half a dozen local surgeons.</p>

    <p>The last I remember they were enticing the negro
    toward the front door in a none too gentle manner,
    while the more enthusiastic half of the audience was
    making for the stage, and the other half, among
    whom was the writer, for the exits. On my way to
    the hotel there passed two police vans loaded to the
    gunwales with a blur of arms and legs.</p>

    <p>The Rijks or Royal Museum stands in a prominent
    location to the south of the Old Town, surrounded
    by the more fashionable residence section and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>Vondel Park. From street floor to gables it is filled
    with objects of historical and technical interest. It
    would take just as long to “do” it thoroughly as
    it would the British Museum in London or the Metropolitan
    in New York. But the tourist in Holland,
    usually of limited time allowance, contents himself
    with a hurried inspection of the different collections
    in the Rijks Museum and a view of the <i>pièce de resistance</i>
    of its picture gallery, namely, the world
    renowned painting by Rembrandt erroneously styled
    “The Night Watch.” Many having been led to
    believe, on account of the very marvelous chiaroscuro
    of the picture, that Rembrandt intended it to represent
    a street scene at night, its present title has
    been given universal usage; but in reality the scene
    depicted takes place in daylight. It is the largest
    and most justly celebrated work by Rembrandt, being
    fourteen and a quarter feet long, and eleven
    and three quarters feet wide. It was painted in
    1642, and represents a small company of arquebusiers
    under Captain Franz Cocq emerging from
    their shooting gallery, or <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">doele</i>&mdash;a name so commonly
    given to Dutch hotels that you will find a “Hotel
    de Doelen” in almost every town in Holland. The
    supposed night shadows in the picture are in truth
    cast by the lofty vaulting of the gallery. The portraits
    of the sixteen members of the guild were done
    from life, and each member represented in the picture
    paid the artist one hundred <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gulden</i>, which remunerated
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>him to the extent of something less than
    $800 for his labors. To-day the painting could not
    be purchased at any price.</p>

    <p>Not the least interesting&mdash;nor most fragrant&mdash;section
    of Amsterdam is its Jewish Quarter, situated
    in the eastern part of the Old Town. The quarter
    is a typical city in itself, for of Amsterdam’s total
    population more than 60,000 are Jews. It possesses
    ten synagogues, the largest of which, erected as early
    as 1670 by the Portuguese Jews and said to resemble
    as far as possible the ancient Temple of Solomon,
    stands in the Muiderstraat. Freedom of religion
    was accorded these persecuted peoples early in the
    history of Amsterdam, and to Amsterdam as an
    asylum they flocked, first from Spain in the fourteenth
    and fifteenth centuries, a little later from Portugal,
    then from the Spanish Netherlands, from Germany,
    and from Poland. In the administration and the commercial
    enterprises of the city their wealth wielded
    much influence.</p>

    <p>Amsterdam is indebted to those Portuguese Jews
    who emigrated from Antwerp in 1576 for the introduction
    of its most widely known industry, that of
    diamond polishing&mdash;an art utterly unknown in
    Europe prior to the fifteenth century. To-day there
    are more than seventy diamond polishing establishments
    in and about the city, employing some 10,000
    men, and they are building a new diamond exchange
    to cost in the neighborhood of $240,000. The cut
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>diamonds exported to the United States from the
    Amsterdam district alone in 1909&mdash;the latest figures
    at my elbow&mdash;were valued at $13,319,417, in addition
    to more than a million dollars’ worth in the
    rough.</p>

    <p>The rules of the London syndicate from which
    every Amsterdam diamond polisher must purchase
    his uncut stones are equally strict with the regulation
    of the diamond workers’ organization.</p>

    <p>In the former case, a diamond polisher must procure
    an introduction to the London merchant through
    the de Beers syndicate in order to obtain a “sight.”
    If a polisher is buying diamonds of one class, say
    Kimberly, he may not under any circumstances obtain
    a “sight” of diamonds of any other class, say
    Jagerfontein. He may examine the parcel of diamonds
    offered to him for a “sight” for fifteen minutes,
    no longer. If they do not suit him his trip to
    London has been of no avail. He must take what
    is offered or nothing, and at the price quoted. Until
    five years ago a polisher was punished by not
    being able to obtain a “sight” for a year if he refused
    to accept a parcel offered for purchase, and
    he would often pay a premium of $4,000 for another
    man’s packet without seeing a stone.</p>

    <p>With regard to the worker, no one in Amsterdam
    may learn the trade of diamond polishing without
    the consent of the organization and unless he be the
    son of a diamond worker or jeweler. He must be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>under eighteen years of age, he must pass a rigid
    examination, and if he desires to become a cleaver&mdash;the
    highest salaried artisan in the diamond industry,
    whose wages often amount to $120 a week&mdash;he must
    pay sometimes as much as $2,000. There are special
    schools in Amsterdam for turners and polishers which
    charge an instruction fee ranging from $120 to $150.</p>

    <p>The rough diamond is first cleaved by hand, or,
    if thought more profitable, it is set in a bar of hot
    lead which, after having cooled, is placed in front of
    a phosphor-bronze saw and sawed in half. Whether
    or not this saw may be used a second time depends
    upon the crystallization of the stone sawed. Some
    stones that, after being sawed, are considered too
    hard to polish, are pulverized and mixed with emery
    dust to be used in making the saws. The two halves
    of the original stone are then handed over to the
    cutters who cut them round, or nearly so, and remove
    the flaws. The polishers then polish the stones and
    make their facets, which, in the case of a gem of
    the first class, number from fifty-eight to sixty-four.</p>

    <p>Amsterdam is also the home of a peculiar institution
    into the workings of which some of our own
    municipalities might delve to their advantage. It
    puts the predatory money-loan shark out of business
    as effectually as a hydrochloric acid bath would a
    potato bug. This institution is the municipal pawnshop,
    known as the Bank of Leening, of which there
    are fifteen branches in the city. It has been in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>successful operation for centuries, the first pawn
    ticket showing the early date of April 29, 1614.
    Loans are made for six months, and all articles
    not redeemed at the expiration of that period are
    sold at public auction. It is interesting to note
    that among the articles disposed of in this manner
    in 1909 were 3,427 sewing machines, 1,325 bicycles,
    and 106 pianos and organs. The maximum loan
    allowed on a single article is approximately $201,
    while the low rates charged have been the cause of
    much anxiety on the part of the independent pawnbrokers,
    and with the desired results. You may
    pawn with the Bank of Leening anything from a
    hair comb to a hair mattress, but it is an acknowledged
    fact that forty per cent. of its business is
    derived from that well-meaning Dutchman addicted
    to the habit of wearing his best suit only on Sunday.
    This he pawns on Monday and redeems on Saturday,
    until the suit wears out from being passed over the
    counter.</p>

    <p>One item more to the credit of Amsterdam: all
    the slaughtering of animals for food must be done
    in the municipal abattoir, and meat which is brought
    in from the country must be inspected there before
    it is offered for sale. The dealers do their own
    slaughtering and must pay for the use of the abattoir
    sixty-four, thirty-four, or ten cents, according to the
    size of each animal slaughtered. Especially constructed
    vans then transfer the meat to the shops
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>of the different dealers. Inasmuch as horseflesh
    is found on the daily menu of many families in
    Amsterdam, 5,444 horses were numbered among the
    150,000 or more animals slaughtered in the municipal
    abattoir in 1909. Mutton, not being in particular
    favor with the Dutch for some unknown reason, cannot
    be bought in many of the meat shops, and there
    is a large central market in Amsterdam that carries
    only mutton as its stock in trade.</p>

    <p>The Bank of Amsterdam antedates the Bank of
    England by almost a century, being founded in 1609.
    Under the administration of the Amsterdam Corporation,
    whose executives examined its specie annually
    in order to verify the statements of its managers,
    the business world became so confident of its solvency
    that its guaranteed certificates were usually
    offered at a premium, and as much as $180,000,000 in
    coin has been held against these certificates at one
    time. Ever since its establishment it has retained its
    place as one of the strongest financial institutions in
    the world.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is doubtful indeed if any other city in Holland
    than Amsterdam can tempt the tourist with a
    greater number of pleasant day’s excursions. Lying
    at the very feet of North Holland&mdash;a travel
    territory no larger in area than the state of Rhode
    Island, but replete with picturesque nooks and
    corners, congested with types and abounding in peculiar
    customs&mdash;every part of the province is readily
    accessible to Amsterdam by rail or by water. Back
    of its central railway station there is a long line of
    docks which berth the boats that only await your
    patronage. Here you may board the large river
    steamer that takes you to Zaandam in half an hour
    for the price of one-half of one Dutch cent a minute;
    here you may take the little excursion boats
    for ports along the Zuyder Zee; here you may engage
    passage to Alkmaar or to The Helder or even
    to Leeuwarden or Groningen or Zwolle, situated in
    that unpenetrated part of the kingdom which may
    be termed the hinterland of Holland; and here you
    may hire a private yacht or motor boat, master and
    all, to carry you whither you will and for as long
    as you wish for as little as five dollars a day inclusive.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>If you cross the arm of the Zuyder Zee
    they call the Ij&mdash;much easier spelled Y&mdash;by ferry
    to the Tolhuis you have only to board the steam tram
    to be rattled across country to Alkmaar, Edam, or
    Volendam. To Haarlem is but fifteen minutes’ ride
    by rail, while The Hague itself is only an hour’s
    trip in the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">schnell zug</i>. Zandvoort, on the North
    Sea, is served by electric train direct from Amsterdam,
    stopping at Haarlem to break the short journey.</p>

    <p>A favorite excursion for a summer’s evening is from
    Amsterdam by steamer to Zaandam, the most typically
    Dutch of all Dutch towns. The course of
    the steamer leads up the North Sea Canal to a
    point a little beyond the Petroleum Harbor and
    then turns off into the river Zaan.</p>

    the most advertised showplace on the tourist’s beaten track</p>
    </div>

    <p>It is in the North Sea Canal that Amsterdam
    places her only hope of ever being able to compete
    with Rotterdam as a shipping port. With its fifteen
    miles of length, its sixty-five to one hundred and ten
    yards of width, and its thirty feet of depth, this
    canal pierces the one-time peninsula of North Holland
    from the Zuyder Zee to its western boundary,
    making an island out of part of the province and
    placing Amsterdam in direct and easy communication
    with the North Sea. An “A.P.” gauge along
    its bank would prove its water level to be about
    twenty inches minus, that is, twenty inches below
    the mean level of the water at Amsterdam&mdash;the
    bench mark of all water levels throughout Holland.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>To cut such a canal across country from one sea
    to another and to protect it at either end with immense
    breakwaters and lock gates has cost the government
    in the neighborhood of $18,000,000 and
    consumed eleven years of patient labor. Since 1895
    its western terminus has been divided into two outlets,
    the older being protected by a lock of three
    openings, while the more recently completed branch,
    diverging a little to the northward from the main
    canal, has but one opening, 245 yards long, 27 yards
    wide, and 33 feet deep.</p>

    <p>Zaandam being the home and breeding ground of
    the windmill, a bird’s-eye view of it would give the
    effect of four inverted centipedes kicking in their
    death throes. It is the center of the Dutch lumber
    trade, and since the windmill is the cheapest method
    of generating the power that any lumber trade requires
    in order to operate its sawmills, Zaandam
    draws from the breeze what we conjure from steam.
    There are upwards of four hundred windmills in its
    immediate vicinity. Its houses, brightly painted
    with green, red, or white, and surrounded with
    pleasant little gardens, gayly reiterate the Dutchman’s
    delight in contrasts, harmonious or otherwise.</p>

    <p>Another of Zaandam’s claims to the consideration
    of the tourist is a little old house near the harbor,
    that belongs, not to any resident of the town, nor
    to any man in Holland, but to the Czar of all the
    Russias personally. It is the house which Peter
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>the Great made his domestic headquarters for a brief
    week in the year 1697 while, as tradition has it, he
    studied shipbuilding incognito in Zaandam. If the
    villagers had not made themselves so pestiferously
    inquisitive and penetrated his disguise a few days
    after his arrival he might have learned a lot from
    Mynheer Kalf, under whose competent tutelage he
    apprenticed himself as a ship carpenter; but the
    idlers about town became too importunate for Peter.
    He gave up his position at the end of a week and
    returned to Amsterdam.</p>

    <p>Volendam, on the west coast of the Zuyder Zee,
    and the little Island of Marken, just opposite, are
    the two most advertised and, therefore, the show
    places in the tourist territory of Holland and enjoy
    the highest patronage. Both are being rapidly and
    ruthlessly spoiled in consequence. However, as these
    are the towns easiest of access from Amsterdam
    that have retained the costumes and customs which
    prevailed hundreds of years ago, embellishing both
    to a certain degree as the signs of the times dictate,
    one feels it his solemn duty, almost, to go there.
    If the gentle reader has been to Amsterdam and has
    weathered the many appeals to make a day’s trip
    to Volendam and Marken we should like to have
    him raise his hand, please, so that we may inquire
    as to the cause and effect of his superb indifference.
    It would be worth noting in the minutes of any
    travel club.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
    <p>The head porter of your hotel in Amsterdam&mdash;a
    sort of unproclaimed passenger agent himself&mdash;will
    try to sell you a round trip ticket to Volendam
    and Marken in one of the many parties, each attended
    by a conductor, which leave every morning
    and return every evening during the season. But,
    if you will bear a personal opinion, that which is
    interesting under the guidance of the prosaic conductor
    is twice as interesting to explore by yourself.
    Start as early as you choose, if you can, and get
    back when you can, if you choose, is the best advice
    I am able to utter with regard to travel through any
    country in the world&mdash;and, on account of its many
    facilities for getting about and the comparative
    meagerness of the territory involved, it is especially
    applicable to Holland.</p>

    <p>Except to obtain a comprehensive view of the great
    dam at the mouth of the Y, a mile and a quarter
    in length, which protects the more delicate construction
    of the North Sea Canal from the ravages of the
    Zuyder Zee, the trip to Marken made by this route
    offers little compensation. The same view can be
    had if you will take the electric car from in front
    of the station in Amsterdam to the St. Anthonis Dyk
    and walk a short distance across to the locks at the
    Oranjesluizen near the north end of the embankment.
    The five openings at this point of the great
    breakwater permit the entrance and exit of vessels
    and regulate the depth of water in the canals. Out
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>of a total of fifty-six lock gates twenty-two are constructed
    of iron.</p>

    <p>Then, too, there seems to be no stability about
    the weather in Holland, and a voyage up the Zuyder
    Zee in a cold, drizzling rain does not encourage
    a pleasant afterthought of the excursion. Upon one
    trip I made up the Zee in the middle of summer the
    climate was of about the same temperature as that
    of a Christmas in Spitzbergen.</p>

    <p>A much more satisfactory route by which to tap
    these towns is the steam tramway line through Monnikendam
    and Edam, the method of procedure in this
    case being to take the ferry from the end of the
    Damrak near the station in Amsterdam to the Tolhuis,
    or old customhouse, across the Y.</p>

    <p>Here near the Tolhuis is the southern entrance to
    the North Holland Canal, with its great lock gates&mdash;a
    channel which simplifies the boat voyage between
    Amsterdam and The Helder, penetrating almost the
    entire length of the province of North Holland, a
    distance of forty-five miles or more, and dividing
    into two the island already made by the North Sea
    Canal. A hundred and thirty feet in width and
    sixteen feet in depth, it was constructed a half century
    before its North Sea predecessor at a cost of
    about $4,000,000, and its water level at Buiksloot,
    the first little station on the tram line, about a mile
    from the Tolhuis, is as much as ten feet below that
    of the sea at half tide.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
    <p>Broek, a little farther along near the tram line,
    is reputed to be the cleanest town in the world, and
    I have not the least doubt that its reputation is well
    deserved. But its motive is ill chosen: it is clean
    for a purpose. By its cleanliness it attracts visitors,
    and so it can scarcely be reckoned as a criterion by
    which to judge the other towns of Holland. No
    doubt it was clean long before it ever had any visitors,
    but since the tourists commenced to hear about its
    hypertrophied spotlessness, they began to visit it;
    now the more visitors it has the cleaner it becomes.
    Like a duck, it is preening itself continuously from
    dawn till dark.</p>

    <p>From Monnikendam you may take steamer direct
    for the Island of Marken, but it will be more to
    your comfort to join the steamer in Marken and
    return through the canals to Amsterdam by way
    of Monnikendam. Such a procedure, however, is
    dependent upon the steamer captain’s consent to the
    proposition; for the boats that ply this route carry
    excursionists exclusively, so that even if the captain
    can be induced to accept you as a passenger you
    may have to pay the full fare for the trip from
    Amsterdam to Marken and return.</p>

    <p>Once&mdash;about three and a half centuries ago&mdash;Monnikendam
    was included in the list of the most
    important towns in Holland. In its halcyon days
    its money chests contained enough bullion to
    provide for the outfitting of a fleet which it sent
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>under spreading canvas up the coast to Hoorn, to
    demonstrate to the skeptics that a Spanish admiral
    <em>could</em> be captured in battle, if only the scheme were
    handled in the proper manner. Long since has Monnikendam
    been relegated to the so-called “dead
    city” class. It is almost too sleepy to keep awake
    in the daytime, arousing but once a year from its
    perennial slumber: when Amsterdam comes on skates
    to hold an ice carnival.</p>

    <p>Back somewhere in the fourteenth century, when
    the only maritime means of access to Amsterdam
    was down the Zuyder Zee, Edam held the strategical
    position of being its picket port. Since those good
    old days its 25,000 population has depreciated
    four-fifths in numbers. Were it not for its brand of
    cheese, flourishing before the gastronomic world a
    perpetual advertisement of the place, Edam would
    soon find itself mentioned in the same breath with
    Broek and Monnikendam. It has a fourteenth century
    Gothic Groote Kerk, tremendous in comparison
    with its population, and a Town Hall in which are
    preserved the portraits of four or five erstwhile citizens
    of Edam, the respective virtues of whom its
    present inhabitants still like to mention as if they
    bore some weight upon the town’s past prosperity.</p>

    <p>One of these local celebrities was a man of the
    name of Osterlen, who, in the 1680’s, could boast
    about a merchant fleet of his own numbering ninety-two
    sail. Three of the others were Trijntje, Peter,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>and Jan. Trijntje (the diminutive in this case must
    have been merely a matter of irony) was said to
    have been nine feet in height and of proportionate
    width; Peter grew an ambiguous beard the dimensions
    of which required it to be tied into a knot in
    order to save it from being stepped on by its master;
    and Jan, an immigrant from Friesland who later procured
    papers of naturalization in Edam&mdash;a “ringer”
    we should have called him in small town baseball parlance&mdash;Jan’s
    net tonnage was four hundred and fifty-four
    pounds on the date when he launched himself
    into the forty-second year of his life.</p>

    <p>At Edam you will scramble into a little sailboat to
    be propelled by the breeze down the canal for a mile
    or more to Volendam. Each side of the ditch&mdash;it
    isn’t much more, if judged by its width; neither is
    its odor any sweeter&mdash;is bordered by low-lying fields
    populated with the black and white bovines directly
    responsible for the principal industry of that section.
    They look docile enough at a distance, these cows
    of North Holland, and they probably are at close
    range, when it comes to showing the proper deference
    due an unmolesting human being, but they are notorious
    for their biased aversion to dogs. The dog seems
    to be their time-honored and ancient enemy, and the
    mere presence of one in the field can cause a deal
    of agitation. If its owner accompanies the dog he
    may be expected to commence a Dutch Marathon
    almost any minute, because, at sight of him, the cow
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>will foreclose with the canine and open speedy negotiations
    with the owner. I have been told that it is
    unsafe even to walk along the canal bank with a
    dog, for only during last summer one staid old
    burgher of Volendam, in so doing, was hooked to
    death, and two ladies of Edam, while taking an
    evening walk, had to be hustled into a passing sailboat
    and pushed out from shore to escape a similar
    fate.</p>

    <p>Every ten feet or so, it seems, someone will be
    fishing, for fishing, more than any other, appears
    to be the national sport of Holland. No self-respecting
    fish would live in some of the canals they
    fish in, but certain species must be able to survive
    their density else the proverbial Dutch patience would
    be soon exhausted.</p>

    <p>The most odoriferous point along the canal from
    Edam to Volendam is in the immediate vicinity of
    a duck farm just near the journey’s end. These
    ducks are the amphibious flies in the amber of what
    is otherwise transparently picturesque. They are
    farmed throughout Holland, but only for their eggs,
    which, being too strong even for the Dutchman to
    relish, are sent to the more cosmopolitan cities or
    exported into the foreign pastry kitchens.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_132.jpg" alt="" width="687" height="400" />
    <p class="center">Land is so scarce in Holland that the pig-sty back of
    the house on the right had to be built out over the canal on piles</p>
    </div>

    <p>Volendam, by reason of the curious costuming of
    its inhabitants, its quaint, narrow main street, high
    above the doorsteps of the bordering brick houses,
    and its picturesque fishing fleet, is the haven of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>artists of all nationalities. One of the most interesting
    picture galleries in the Netherlands comprises
    the public rooms of the Hotel Spaander, hung with
    sketches, more or less frivolous, and finished works,
    more or less serious, done spontaneously by the hands
    of such illustrators and painters as Phil May, Will
    Owen, Edward Penfield, William Chase, and Burne-Jones.
    The back yard of the hotel, which, without
    the least excuse, it advertises as an “attractive garden,”
    is fringed with old buildings, each roof exchanged
    within the comparative recent development
    of the town as an art center for the skylight of the
    unmistakable studio.</p>

    <p>Sunday, by all odds, is the most advantageous day
    of the week to visit Volendam. Then are the dresses
    of its women folk and the breeches of its men, copious
    as meal sacks, garnished with the jewelry and the
    silver buckles respectively which have been handed
    down as heirlooms from mother to daughter, from
    father to son, even unto the third and fourth generations.
    Then is the fishing fleet jammed together in
    the little harbor to spend its accustomed week end
    of lethargy, each masthead flying its long, narrow
    pennant&mdash;a sight which from a distance might be
    mistaken for a hibernating flock of wild fowl. You
    would have to use a rifle with an elbow in its barrel
    to be able to shoot through this patch of pine forest
    with its top cut off without puncturing one mast
    at least. On other days of the week Volendam’s
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>citizens are preoccupied with whatever they have to
    attend to, but on Sunday they stand around and
    pose gracefully and easily for the commendation of
    the visiting public.</p>

    <p>The garb of the male Volendamer is about as
    characteristic as any regalia in Holland. His round,
    flat-crowned cap permits the exposure of its owner’s
    bronzed and finely cut features. He wears a loosely
    tied scarf about his neck, and his shirt or jersey
    usually displays a large patch cut from another shirt
    or jersey regardless of any probable ambition to
    match the patterns. Whenever and wherever the
    garment wears out, then and there it is patched, and
    by their patches ye shall know them; that is, you
    can come within measurable proximity of telling the
    daily duties of every man by the position of his
    patches. One will have a livid green patch down
    the collar bone of a dark maroon jersey; another will
    display a different colored sleeve from the elbow
    down. The Volendamer’s trousers extend in a southerly
    direction to the tops of the ankles only, and
    are built with a voluminously exaggerated peg-top
    effect, so much so that each cavernous side pocket
    must hold at least a peck, and to be able to find
    with any degree of proficiency such an insignificant
    article as a penknife in its depths, the wearer would
    have to go into early training as a contortionist.
    Week days he wears <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">klompen</i>, or the ordinary poplarwood
    shoes, which may be used for as many different
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>and distinct purposes as the owner’s ingenuity may
    contrive&mdash;such as amusing the little tots by sailing
    a <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">klomp</i> across the canal as a boat, or tying one
    on the end of a rod and offering it to the canal boat
    master as a receptacle in which to drop the toll
    as he poles his barge through the locks. The <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vrouw</i>
    sees that her “man” removes his <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">klompen</i> before
    he dares enter the house, and upon each doorstep
    you will invariably behold one or more pairs, including,
    perhaps, those of a visitor in the kitchen
    paying his respects in his stocking feet. On Sundays,
    however, the more fastidious Volendamer will
    break the monotony by changing the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">klompen</i> for
    the more genteel-looking low, leather, pump-like
    slippers.</p>

    <p>The most distinguishable feature of the Volendam
    feminine attire from that found on the Island of
    Walcheren or at Scheveningen, for example, is the
    immaculate white cap, somewhat of the shape of a
    miniature miter, terminating at the sides in two
    stiffly starched points that curl out from the ears
    like the horns of a water buffalo. The hair is cropped
    close and, according to the prevailing rules of decorum,
    only a fringe of it is allowed to be visible.
    Never under any conditions should a man see an
    unmarried member of Volendam’s gentler sex with
    her head uncovered.</p>

    <p>Over in Marken the proper thing to do to complete
    the delusion is to allow one of the many children
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>who pester the passengers upon landing from
    the boat to lead you to his home, reimbursing him
    financially to the extent demanded&mdash;not a very vast
    sum, in any event. It will be a scrupulously clean
    little place of one, and not often more than two
    rooms. It will contain the usual amount of brass-work
    and a nondescript collection of Delft ware.
    The floor will be brick, the fireplace will have its
    ingle nooks, and its pot of whatever-it-is suspended
    over the fire from a crane, will be simmering gently.
    In the side walls will be built the sleeping accommodations,
    like bunks on a ship, draped with curtains
    at night and closed to view&mdash;and air&mdash;in the daytime
    by means of paneled wooden doors. This will
    be about all to see in Marken, and you will be happy
    enough to be led back to the boat to escape further
    mercenary moves on the part of the populace.</p>

    <p>The shirt of the male Markener can show as many
    patches as that of the male Volendamer, but instead
    of the little round cap he sees fit to favor a sort of
    derby hat having a two-inch crown. His breeches
    are of the knickerbocker type, but still very much
    peg-topped, and his <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">klompen</i> are sometimes varnished
    yellow and carved in more or less delicate tracery.
    Unlike those of Volendam, the women of Marken
    let the hair grow, plaiting it into two braids which
    hang down, one from each ear, in defiance to any
    custom that may obtain across on the mainland.</p>

    <h2 title="X Alkmaar and The Helder">X<br />
    <span class="chap_name">Alkmaar and The Helder</span></h2>


    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is as imperative that the traveler through Holland
    should journey from Amsterdam to Alkmaar
    by canal as it is that he should not overlook
    the steam tram trip between The Hague and Leyden.</p>

    <p>The twenty-four and a half miles between the
    commercial metropolis and the cheese capital of
    North Holland is made in a little less than three
    hours. Taking all things into consideration, it is
    one of the most enjoyable steamboat excursions in
    the kingdom. Bearing up through the North Sea
    Canal and the River Zaan, the packet makes its first
    stop at Zaandam; then on up the river it winds between
    the bristling windmills, turns from one canal
    into another, crosses a small lake, and finally negotiates
    the waterway that leads eventually to Alkmaar.
    The <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">polders</i> on either hand are far below the level
    of the water you are steaming over, so that you see
    no more than the tops of the farmhouses. Although
    the wake of the passing boat rattles the reeds along
    the banks, the fishermen concealed here and there
    among them seem not the least perturbed, but continue
    to fish with all their might and main, allowing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>the steamer to play what havoc it will with the movements
    and inclinations of their prey.</p>

    <p>Alkmaar, and not Edam, is the geographical and
    industrial center of the cheese trade of North Holland,
    and the cheese market is the geographical and
    industrial center of Alkmaar. To give some idea
    of the length of time they have been marketing
    cheeses in Alkmaar you will be told upon inquiry
    that the town weigh-house was constructed in 1582,
    and for no other purpose than to weigh the cheeses
    bought and sold at the weekly market. To give
    some idea of the town’s importance as a cheese center,
    the astonishing number of forty-odd million
    pounds of round, golden cheeses are bargained for
    at the side of the weigh-house in every twelve months.</p>

    <p>In addition to the weigh-house the town boasts
    of but few historically remunerative objects of interest.
    There is the old Church of St. Lawrence,
    built in 1470, the surrounding walls and buttresses
    of which protect a part of the eminent remains of
    Floris <abbr title="5">V</abbr>, Count of Holland and builder of the Hall
    of the Knights at The Hague, although why they
    were interred at such a distance to the north of the
    scenes of his activity is a matter of some conjecture;
    there are a few relics and mediocre paintings on
    show in the Municipal Museum; and there is the old
    water gate that seems to forbid any farther penetration
    into the town on the part of the packet from
    Amsterdam. In history Alkmaar played its solemn
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>rôle by making a stubborn and ultimately successful
    resistance against the besieging Spaniards in 1573.
    Five to one were the odds against which the burghers
    fought and, as at Leyden, the water of the ocean
    was the all-powerful lever that rewarded the besieged
    and routed the besiegers.</p>

    <p>As early as daybreak the Friday visitor&mdash;for
    Friday is cheese day in Alkmaar&mdash;will find plenty of
    activity in the vicinity of the town weigh-house.
    It is therefore advisable to reach the place the previous
    Thursday evening, because the unloading of
    the cheeses and the stacking of them upon the stone
    pavement of the market square during the early hours
    of the following morning are among the most interesting
    phases of the whole proceeding. And so,
    by daylight on Friday, gayly painted farm wagons
    from the surrounding country already fringe three
    sides of the market, and every one of them is disgorging,
    two at a time, its load of golden cheeses.
    On the canal that bounds the fourth side of the
    square lie berthed a double row of long, narrow boats,
    also loaded from keel plate to hatch cover with the
    product of the district. From every point of the
    compass cheeses are being tossed through the air
    from the wagons and boats, only to have their flight
    checked with a smack by the men who catch them
    and pile them upon the pavement in long, double-decked
    rows, ten cheeses in width. Later, canvas
    is thrown over the piles to protect the cheeses from</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
    <p>the rays of the sun until it is time for the cheese
    makers and the wholesale commission merchants from
    the cities, soon to descend upon the scene, to commence
    their dickerings. All through the early morning
    this unloading continues, its accompanying
    smacks to be heard half a block away, until perhaps
    250,000 cheeses have been piled up in neat rows
    with alleyways between them, across the market
    square from one edge to the other.</p>

    <p>At half-past nine, half an hour before the market
    opens, the weighmen, all garbed in immaculate white,
    meet in executive session in the weigh-house and
    absorb a ceremonious talking-to by the superintendent
    of the market&mdash;probably upon the subject of
    honest weights and the penalties to be imposed upon
    the unfortunate man caught trifling with the rules and
    regulations of the game.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center">Friday is cheese day in Alkmaar, and by daylight gaily
    painted farm wagons are disgorging their loads of golden cheeses on the
    pavement in front of the Town Weigh-house</p>
    </div>

    <p>These weighmen constitute a distinct feature of
    every cheese market in Holland. Their dress may
    seem ludicrous and their duties a bit undignified,
    but they go about their calling with all the seriousness
    of statesmen. Until recently they were divided, one
    might say, into four colors: red, blue, green, and
    yellow, as distinguished by their hat bands. Latterly,
    a fifth color, orange, has been added. In the weigh-house
    there are five pairs of scales, each pair painted
    a different color corresponding to the colors of the
    weighmen. The “red” weighmen must weigh their
    barrowfuls of cheeses upon the “red” scales; the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>“blue” weighmen, upon the “blue” scales, and so
    on. An Alkmaar cheese weighman holds a life position,
    is elected by the community, and receives in
    commissions a certain percentage, determined by the
    value of the cheeses, of each hundred kilos weighed,
    or fraction thereof.</p>

    <p>At ten o’clock promptly the heavy sheets of canvas
    are dragged from the piles. The market is thus
    officially opened, and for the ensuing two hours the
    visitor will be treated to some of the shrewdest of
    shrewd Dutch bargaining. The stolid, unemotional
    makers of cheeses stand doggedly by their respective
    piles, while the crafty wholesale merchants flit hither
    and yon testing. Not a word passes between them
    other than a surly “how d’ y’ do” in Dutch. The
    merchant selects a cheese at random, jams into it an
    instrument that any competent housewife might mistake
    for an apple corer, gives it a twist, pulls it out
    slowly, and tastes the end of the sample thus taken.
    What remains of the sample is drawn from the instrument,
    slipped back into the parent cheese, and
    the tester moves along to attack another pile.</p>

    <p>At the end of an hour every merchant on the
    ground will have tested and tasted every pile of
    cheeses&mdash;in itself no small saporific achievement. Not
    only will he have used the taste test on the different
    piles, but he will have called upon his other four
    senses to confirm or countervail its decision. He
    will have examined cheeses by sight; he will have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>held them to his ear and shaken them, as we might
    an egg; he will have felt of the weight and solidity
    of them; and he will have taken long, knowing whiffs
    of their fragrance. At the end of an hour, then,
    he is qualified to approach this or that particular
    dealer and offer him so much per hundred kilos for
    his cheeses. Then it is that Greek meets Greek. In
    a moment’s time the dull-looking, uncommunicative,
    apparently unconcerned provincial maker of cheese
    seems to be transformed into a cunning, canny, clear-headed
    man of business. The two of them, merchant
    and maker, stand for a full minute with their right
    hands outstretched, like a picture of Captain John
    Smith sealing a treaty with the Indians. Suppose
    the maker finally agrees to the price offered: without
    uttering a syllable he grips the hand of the merchant,
    and the bargain is closed. If he does not
    agree, he slaps the merchant’s hand a whack that
    resounds across the square. By eleven-fifteen the
    walls of the surrounding houses reverberate with
    what a stranger around the corner might easily suppose
    to be the premature explosion of a number of
    toy balloons&mdash;for cheese makers are but human and
    would rather wait in the hope of being offered more
    for their stock. Competition is the essence of trade,
    even in Holland.</p>

    <p>When a bargain is negotiated, they call a pair of
    weighmen who load the cheeses upon a barrow&mdash;a
    queer kind of barrow that resembles more a stretcher
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>on sled runners&mdash;and carry them to the scales to
    be weighed. After being weighed and their sale recorded
    upon the books of the superintendent, the
    cheeses are loaded back into the wagons and boats
    to be transferred to the warehouse for shipment.</p>

    <p>The cheese goes through no further preliminaries
    if intended for native consumption. If destined for
    export, however, it must needs undergo a peculiar,
    yet withal a simple process: it must be well scraped
    and painted over with a thin aniline dye which
    rapidly turns as it dries to a glorious vermilion.
    The scraping is done by machinery, but the dyeing
    is done by hand and with almost incredible swiftness
    by the men employed in some of the establishments
    in Alkmaar.</p>

    <p>The question was asked if the dyeing assisted in
    the preservation of the cheese or helped to keep it
    immune from mould or corrodings. Not at all. The
    ultimate consumer across the seas would turn up
    his nose at an un-dyed cheese and snub it as a
    cheap imitation. The foreign public demands that
    the genuine North Holland cheese bear a distinctive
    hall-mark. That hall-mark is its coat of red dye.
    Since this province probably supplies a good three-fifths
    of the 55,000 tons of cheese exported in a
    single year the reader can imagine what a deal of
    red dye it takes to satisfy a foreign fancy.</p>

    <p>A distance of thirty miles or more north of Alkmaar
    lies The Helder, figuratively the top of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>kingdom. Geographically, it is only in the same
    latitude as the most northerly point of Newfoundland
    at the Straits of Belle Isle, and so there are
    plenty of towns over in Friesland and Groningen
    that lie still farther to the north, but these do not
    have the conditions to contend with that does The
    Helder. Surrounded on three sides by the waters
    of the Zuyder Zee and the North Sea, The Helder
    assumes much of the responsibility of protecting the
    whole province of North Holland from a general and
    disastrous inundation. More than any other part
    of the province, indeed of all Holland, it is exposed
    to the ravages of the most violent winds, which kick
    the sea into a maelstrom and pound it with relentless
    fury upon the coast line.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_144.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="400" />
    <p class="center">At The Helder may be seen the “big story” of
    Holland—the dikes that represent the persistent, patient strife of the
    Dutch to hold the land made out of the sea bottom</p>
    </div>

    <p>Here at The Helder may be found the finest fruits
    of that “big story” of Holland: the constant battle
    of mere man against an all but omnipotent element&mdash;water;
    the romantic, persistent, patient strife of the
    Hollander to insure as much as possible his own
    safety and that of the land which he has weaned
    from the sea from utter and inexorable annihilation.
    If for nothing else, it is for this “big story” that
    one should go to The Helder. If the traveler through
    Holland has not been already duly impressed with
    the silent, continuous fight of the Dutch for mere
    existence, he will return from this northernmost promontory
    of North Holland with augmented faith in
    the ingenuity and dogged perseverance of the men
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>who have made a country out of what once was sea
    bottom.</p>

    <p>The foregoing preamble is meant to prepare the
    traveler to appreciate The Helder. If it fails in
    its mission, it may be all for the best, because the
    unanticipated often strikes with the greatest degree
    of accuracy and forcefulness and brands the experience
    upon the mind, never to be obliterated.</p>

    <p>Disembarking from the train, you will turn instinctively
    to the north through a wide avenue&mdash;a
    veritable tunnel through the trees. After crossing
    the drawbridge that spans the canal at the end of
    the avenue, you must turn abruptly to the left. The
    first cross street&mdash;little more than an alleyway between
    the houses&mdash;is barricaded at its farther extremity
    by a steep, grass-grown embankment that
    towers almost to the same altitude as the chimney
    pots of the house tops below. A flight of thirty-one
    steps ascends to the top of this peculiar embankment
    and you scramble up, expecting to behold
    on the other side a view of&mdash;you scarcely know what.
    You are surprised to discover that the view is a
    sea-scape, for, if you have failed to observe The
    Helder’s lofty lighthouse, it has not been suggested
    to you that the sea is anywhere in the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>You will be standing on the top of one of the
    greatest and strongest dikes in Holland, its business
    side stretching away before you at an angle of forty
    degrees for two hundred feet into the Strait of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>Marsdiep. Extending a total distance of five miles
    in the arc of a circle, this, then, is the sloping buttress
    that North Holland relies upon for its very life. A
    severe storm will lash the water of the strait into
    spray, and fling it across into the windows of the
    bordering houses, but the highest of tides cannot
    come over the backbone of the dike, while at all
    times the water laps restlessly at its foundations.
    The top of the dike is mounted with a roadway twelve
    feet in width. Some feet above the water line at
    low tide the tops of great stone breakwaters, like the
    ribs of a dinosaur, stretch seaward at regular intervals.
    The whole of this remarkable artificial
    coast is constructed of Norwegian granite.</p>

    <p>Upon the summits of a few sand dunes that raise
    themselves here and there behind the dike the Dutch
    have completed the construction of some rather crude
    military fortifications which Napoleon commenced
    in 1811. But improvements upon them are going
    on apace, for Holland is not exactly anxious to
    suffer an experience with regard to her string of
    islands in the north, in furthering German aggrandizement
    as did the Danes of Helgoland before the
    gun muzzles of the British in 1807.</p>

    <p>The single point of North Holland, however, most
    exposed to sea encroachments is a few miles south
    of The Helder on the North Sea. Here there is a
    chain of three great dikes, one beyond the other,
    named significantly, beginning with the one farthest
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>from the shore, “The Waker,” “The Dreamer,” and
    “The Sleeper.” Still farther to the south, on the
    same side of the province, are the great sand dunes,
    three miles in width in some places, under the protection
    of which the freight boats from Amsterdam
    creep to their destinations along the North Sea
    Canal.</p>

    <p>Off the northern dunes the combined English and
    French fleets of war suffered defeat at the hands
    of the Dutch admirals, de Ruyter and Tromp, two
    hundred thirty-eight years ago to the day, as I
    write (the 21st of August), and in September, 1799,
    two armies of 10,000 and 13,000, English and Russian
    troops respectively, commanded by the Duke of
    York, landed here to try their luck at tempting the
    Dutch to revolt against the French. The Russian
    forces lost their way and were defeated by the French
    before they had advanced as far as Alkmaar, and
    the British, bearing in mind the comforting old
    adage about discretion being the best part of valor,
    retreated after having penetrated as far south as
    Castricum, near Zaandam.</p>

    <p>In the town of The Helder itself&mdash;why they refer
    to it as “The” Helder I do not know, unless it be
    for the reason that the article makes of it a pseudonym
    for a Dutch John o’ Groats&mdash;in the town itself
    there is little of interest. One street I have in mind,
    however, which is of rather peculiar construction.
    The north side of it, from the middle of what ought
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>to be the common roadway, is possibly three and a
    half feet higher than its south side, the upper part
    built upon an embankment faced with a brick wall.</p>

    <p>The place is full of Dutch sailors and navy people,
    for about three quarters of a mile down the dike
    lies Nieuwediep, the Dutch combination of Hampton
    Roads, Annapolis, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
    Situated at the mouth of the North Holland Canal,
    Nieuwediep is the most important naval station in
    Holland, maintaining large wharves, docks, machine
    shops, and a naval academy, the students of which,
    two, four, and six abreast&mdash;Holland’s future Tromps
    and de Ruyters&mdash;can be seen strolling up and down
    the great dike. A fraction of the country’s one hundred
    vessels of war and of her 8,000 men that man
    them receive their orders at the station at Nieuwediep.</p>

    <p>Across the Strait of Marsdiep is the Island of
    Texel, the most southerly unit of the long series of
    vertebræ that curve far to the northeast, as if
    made to fit exactly the coast lines of the provinces
    of Friesland and Groningen. A steamer plies to
    Texel from Nieuwediep and returns four times daily;
    but you may profitably omit the island from your
    itinerary unless you are particularly interested in
    natural history and you happen to come upon Texel
    during the bird nesting season. The northern extremity
    of the island, called Eyerland, or “The Land
    of Eggs,” is infested with sea fowl, the eggs of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>which are collected by the myriads and shipped to
    the large cities. Texel is seventy-three square miles
    in area and supports one or two very plain bathing
    places, but most of its six thousand inhabitants
    are chiefly engaged in the business of sheep raising
    on the long, crater-like pasture land hemmed in by
    the sand dunes.</p>

    <h2 title="XI From Hoorn to Stavoren">XI<br />
    <span class="chap_name">From Hoorn to Stavoren</span></h2>


    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the matter of ancient buildings, Hoorn is one
    of the gems of all the towns of Holland. Its fine
    old harbor tower, its Town Hall, its weigh-house,
    its Oosterpoort&mdash;the most prominent remaining factor
    of the walls that once surrounded the town&mdash;its
    assortment of quaint old gateways and entrances,
    its steep-roofed dwellings and warehouses that lean
    forward or backward at more acute angles than even
    the oldest buildings in Amsterdam&mdash;all combine in
    contributing to Hoorn a medieval charm that is
    puissant and irresistible.</p>

    <p>But whatever Hoorn may be noted for as she
    stands to-day, her name has gone down in history
    as that of the mother of Dutch navigators. Three
    of them were famous in their day: Schouten, Tasman,
    and Coen; and, in the eye of the Dutch nation, the
    greatest of these was Coen&mdash;Jan Pieters Coen, the
    founder of the Dutch dominions in the East Indies
    and the creator of Batavia as their capital. A statue
    of him in bronze stands in the Kaasmarkt of the town
    of his birth.</p>

    <p>Tasman was numbered among the foremost discoverers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>of the seventeenth century. In the year
    1639 he was assigned to a voyage of exploration
    by Van Dieman, the governor general of the Dutch
    East Indies at the time, his cruise leading him to
    the Western Pacific. After exploring part of the
    coast of Luzon in the Philippine Islands, he sailed
    farther to the northward and around Japan, but,
    discovering no land not already nailed to the flag of
    some nation, he set sail again for home on October
    15th of the same year.</p>

    <p>The Hollanders having already discovered and explored
    a part of the west coast of Australia, the
    Dutch East India Company was desirous of obtaining
    fuller and more accurate information about the
    territory with a view of exploiting its natural resources
    and whatever others the company itself might
    develop. Accordingly, on August 14, 1642, Tasman
    was dispatched from Batavia in command of two
    ships and intrusted with the task of bringing back
    a full and authentic account of whatever he saw
    and conquered. Owing to the inaccuracy of his
    sailing charts, head winds that blew him from his
    prescribed course, and what not, he went south of
    his mark, and came upon a hitherto undiscovered
    country which he promptly named Van Dieman’s
    Land, in honor of his sponsor. But being unaware
    that what is now known as Tasmania was an island
    by its own right, he hoisted his flag and set to work
    exploring what he thought at the time to be the most
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>of Australia. He set sail again from the newly discovered
    territory, bearing to the eastward with a
    vague idea of reaching the Solomon Islands. On the
    13th of December he discovered a “high, mountainous
    country,” which he noted in his log book as
    “Staatenland.” For some unaccountable reason the
    English have allowed its name to remain as New
    Zealand, neglecting to change it when they took it
    over, as they did that of the Dutch colony of New
    Amsterdam.</p>

    <p>William Schouten, having had an earlier relapse
    under the spell of the spray, was the first to sail
    round the southern extremity of South America, his
    goal being one and the same with that of Henry
    Hudson, who attempted a supposed route to China
    from Amsterdam, first by way of the Chesapeake
    Bay, and later, the Hudson River. Schouten, in
    passing, christened the point “Cape Hoorn,” latterly
    contracted to “Horn,” in honor of his birthplace.</p>

    <p>In addition to these, Hoorn refers proudly to the
    exploits of another of her sons, John Haring by
    name, a Dutch Horatius whose signal courageous
    achievement consisted in holding in check, single-handed,
    a round thousand of Spaniards, while his
    compatriots gathered themselves together in order
    to retreat in a systematic manner at least.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center">An old street in Hoorn. In the matter of ancient
    buildings the town is one of the gems of Holland</p>
    </div>

    <p>It took place before Amsterdam in 1573, when
    the city was held in the grip of the Dons. The
    Prince of Orange had taken up a position to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>south of the city, and Sonoy, his general, was encamped
    to the north. The operations of both were
    hampered by the lack of sufficient forces. Sonoy
    having gone to Edam for the purpose of gathering
    reinforcements, the Spaniards in his absence made
    a concentrated attack upon his division entrenched
    behind the Diemer Dike. Seeing the fight was going
    against his fellows, Haring of Hoorn, as Motley relates,
    “planted himself entirely alone upon the dike,
    where it was so narrow between the Y on the one
    side and the Diemer Lake on the other that two
    men could hardly stand abreast. Here, armed with
    a sword and a shield, he had actually opposed and
    held in check one thousand of the enemy, during a
    period long enough to enable his own men, if they
    had been willing, to rally and effectually to repel
    the attack. It was too late&mdash;the battle was too far
    lost to be restored; but still the brave soldier held
    his post, till, by his devotion, he enabled all those
    of his compatriots who still remained in the entrenchments
    to make good their retreat. He then plunged
    into the sea, and, untouched by spear or bullet,
    effected his escape.”</p>

    <p>But John Haring survived only to suffer death
    in the attempt of an equally valiant feat a few months
    later before the sea-gates of his own native town.</p>

    <p>The siege of Alkmaar having terminated unhappily
    for the Spaniards, they dispatched a fleet from
    Amsterdam under Count Bossu, to effect the surrender
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>of Hoorn and Enkhuizen. No sooner had
    the project been contemplated than the Dutch got
    wind of it; Admiral Dirkzoon sailed in command of
    a fleet of twenty-five vessels, and, having had favorable
    winds and weather, bore down upon the Spanish
    armada near Hoorn.</p>

    <p>“After a short and general engagement,” according
    to Motley, “nearly all the Spanish fleet retired
    with precipitation, closely pursued by most of the
    patriot Dutch vessels. Five of the King’s ships were
    eventually taken&mdash;the rest effected their escape.
    Only the Admiral remained, who scorned to yield,
    although his forces had thus basely deserted him.
    His ship, the <em>Inquisition</em>, for such was her insolent
    appellation, was far the largest and best manned
    of both fleets. Most of the enemy had gone in
    pursuit of the fugitives, but four vessels of inferior
    size had attacked the <em>Inquisition</em> at the commencement
    of the action. Of these, one had soon been
    silenced, while the other three had grappled themselves
    inextricably to her sides and prow. The four
    drifted together, before wind and tide, a severe and
    savage action going on incessantly, during which the
    navigation of the ships was entirely abandoned. No
    scientific gunnery, no military or naval tactics, were
    displayed or required in such a conflict. It was a
    life-and-death combat, such as always occurred when
    Spaniard and Netherlander met, whether on land or
    water. Bossu and his men, armed with bullet-proof
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
    coats of mail, stood with shield and sword on the
    deck of the <em>Inquisition</em>, ready to repel all attempts
    to board. The Hollanders, as usual, attacked with
    pitch hoops, boiling oil, and molten lead. Repeatedly
    they effected their entrance to the Admiral’s
    ship, and as often they were repulsed and slain in
    heaps, or hurled into the sea. The battle began at
    three in the afternoon, and continued without intermission
    throughout the whole night. The vessels,
    drifting together, struck on the shoal called the Nek,
    near Wydeness. In the heat of the action the occurrence
    was hardly heeded. In the morning twilight,
    John Haring of Hoorn, the hero who had kept
    one thousand soldiers at bay upon the Diemer dike,
    clambered on board the <em>Inquisition</em>, and hauled her
    colors down. The gallant but premature achievement
    cost him his life. He was shot through the
    body, and died on the deck of the ship, which was
    not quite ready to strike her flag.... At eleven
    o’clock Admiral Bossu surrendered, and with three
    hundred prisoners was carried into Holland. Bossu
    was himself imprisoned at Hoorn, in which city he
    was received, on his arrival, with great demonstrations
    of popular hatred.”</p>

    <p>It was on a feast-day that I came upon Hoorn, and
    the place was garbed in gala attire. Throughout
    the morning the hotel stableboys were kept busy
    tending the horses of rural arrivals, and every stable-yard
    was congested with wagonettes and carts.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>Never have I seen such a variety of vehicles. There
    was the painted produce wagon with its white canvas
    cover; there was the gayly decorated antique “two-wheeler,”
    its body swung upon heavy straps held fore
    and aft at the ends of great protruding springs;
    there was the commodious, shapely cart of plum-colored
    upholstery, belonging to the “gentleman
    farmer”; and there was a host of others too numerous
    to describe in detail.</p>

    <p>Hoorn’s main street had been roped off, and the
    bricks covered with a thick layer of sand, in preparation
    for the series of horse races that was soon to
    take place up and down its length. Along about
    noon the Dutch David Harums led their horses down
    to the improvised race track behind the village band
    in all its glory, and the festivities were on.</p>

    <p class="center">Hoorn on a feast-day. The main street has been roped off
    and its brick paving covered with sand in preparation for a series of
    horse races</p>
    </div>

    <p>Running races were of necessity tabooed on account
    of the danger to life and property&mdash;the actions
    of the horse being restricted to such an extent by
    the limited fairway of the course that, in event of
    the horse’s losing its head, even the side ropes along
    the street could not restrain it from dashing through
    the crowd and into the window of the nearest cheese
    shop. But there were sulky races between the Hal
    Pointers and the Palo Altos of the district, driven
    with rope reins by erstwhile jockeys, some of the
    costumes of whom were no less curious than the harness
    of the horses. Breeches, in some cases, and
    blouses, in others, looked as if they might have been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>recently redeemed from many years of confinement
    in Amsterdam’s municipal pawnshop, their public sale
    having been repeatedly overlooked.</p>

    <p>Riding, instead of driving, would seem with us a
    less effective method of developing the speed of a
    trotting horse, and it certainly appears to be a less
    comfortable one, but ride them they do in many parts
    of Holland. I can imagine only one reason for the
    prevalence of the custom, and that is that the trotting
    horses are so rotund and ponderous that the shafts
    of no sulky would fit them, and if it did, no driver
    could spread his lower limbs so far apart as to drive
    the horse from the sulky’s seat. Large and ample
    as Percherons are some of these North Holland and
    Friesland horses, with long, well-groomed tails and
    manes; but they have a faster gait than they might
    be given credit for when seen hitched to a cart or
    a farm wagon. Pads with knee braces, which serve
    the riders in place of saddles, are strapped to the
    horses’ backs, and they trot the course with but
    little less action than blue grass Kentuckians. A
    singular thing is that they seldom “break,” their
    weight apparently holding them to the trot.</p>

    <p>The express trains from Amsterdam to Leeuwarden
    make the run in just over three hours and a half,
    including the ferry passage of an hour and ten
    minutes across the neck of the Zuyder Zee from
    Enkhuizen to Stavoren. The line runs through
    Zaandam to Hoorn and thence to Enkhuizen through
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>the richest farming district in North Holland. The
    farmhouses, somewhat more substantially built than
    those in the south, resemble what we rather ambiguously
    call “country residences.” They have their
    lawns and their gardens full of flowers, and each is
    surrounded with its little moat, bridged by a tiny
    archway which connects the house with the road at
    but a single point.</p>

    <p>Enkhuizen is the unfortunate victim of what its
    inhabitants must consider to be a depraved taste for
    salmon rather than herring. The Rhine salmon has
    taken the place of the humble herring on the Dutch
    menu cards, and the town of Enkhuizen has dwindled
    accordingly. Of its fleet of four hundred herring
    vessels and its population of 40,000 souls in the
    seventeenth century, not a single fishing smack and
    only 6,300 descendants of its earlier inhabitants
    remain.</p>

    <p>Aside from the magnitude of its one-time fishing
    industry, Enkhuizen courts the fickleness of fame
    by being the birthplace of Paul Potter. Born in
    1625, he painted his most renowned canvas, “The
    Bull”&mdash;now in the Mauritshuis at The Hague&mdash;at
    the age of two-and-twenty, and died but seven years
    later&mdash;only another of the many instances where
    Death has chosen to lay his hand upon the shoulder
    of one so young and signally gifted in preference
    to an octogenarian dullard.</p>

    <p>Waiting alongside the dock station at Enkhuizen
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>will be the side-wheel steamer that ferries the passengers
    the fourteen miles across the Zuyder Zee
    to Stavoren in Friesland. The old Dromedary Tower,
    as they call it, at the harbor, diminishes rapidly into
    the general skyline of Enkhuizen, and you will be
    sailing out over what was once a broad isthmus of
    dry land&mdash;for the Zuyder Zee was not always the
    Zuyder Zee. Until the thirteenth century it consisted
    of but a comparatively small inland lake called
    Flevo. Near the close of that cycle&mdash;in 1282, to
    give the exact year&mdash;the German ocean burst over
    the land from the north, wiping the lives of 80,000
    people out of existence and combining itself and
    Lake Flevo into one, which was henceforth called the
    Zuyder Zee. Above the ferry crossing, beginning at
    the eastern end of the little island of Wieringen, they
    will build the contemplated dam across it, the first
    process in the reclamation of more than a million
    acres of what was once a fertile, productive district.</p>

    <p>In pleasant weather it is a beautiful trip across
    the neck of the Zee, but if the breeze blows from
    the north, bringing with it the customary cold
    drizzle of rain, the best method of putting in the
    time is to go below to the cabin and follow the invariable
    custom of the country of eating bread and
    great, thin slices of Dutch cheese.</p>

    <p>Stavoren is the deadest of all the “dead cities
    of the Zuyder Zee.” At the beginning of the thirteenth
    century the merchants of Stavoren were prepotent
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>among the rulers of the world of trade and
    commerce. Treasures from all the then known
    corners of the earth lay in their storehouses. The
    homes of these merchant princes were palaces comparable
    only with those of kings and furnished with
    the sumptuousness and incomputable grandeur of
    the famous abodes of the Sultan Harun-al-Rashid
    in the “Arabian Nights.” Previously, Stavoren had
    been the residence of all the Frisian princes. But
    riches contributed to the pride that came before its
    fall. To-day the census taker counts its population
    in three figures and its commerce is not worthy of
    mention in a trade report. The smoke of the lingering
    express train that will subsequently carry you
    to Friesland’s capital is the only evidence that the
    town may not be abandoned completely.</p>

    <p>As you sail into the harbor, a wide, grass-grown
    embankment in front of the town can be seen plainly
    from the steamer’s deck. This is the Vrouwensand,
    and it recalls the legend that attributes the fall of
    Stavoren to the whims of a woman. The reader
    himself must be the judge whether or not the tale
    is worth the telling. One writer on Holland asserts
    that no author dealing previously with the country
    in a literary way has been gifted either with the
    independence or the imprudence to avoid it. His
    predecessors have been numerous and illustrious, and
    if the story be so important that each of them has
    seen fit to relate it, I can do naught but imitate.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>
    <p>Of all the inhabitants of the old city of Stavoren,
    none was so blessed with riches as the wife of a
    certain wealthy merchant. Continually bathed in
    the high lights of smiling fortune, she plucked one
    by one the treasures that were thrown daily at her
    feet. She owned everything of intrinsic value that
    the fabulous wealth of her husband could bestow
    upon her. But one thing she did not possess, and
    that was love. Her character was devoid of a
    woman’s tenderness. She was cold, indifferent, supercilious,
    insouciant. Exaggerated pride in her own
    wealth and an undying envy of those whose fortunes
    dared to compete with hers&mdash;these were the only
    passions of her life.</p>

    <p>One day, while acting as hostess at a great banquet,
    a stranger from the Far East was ushered
    into the room. He had come, he said, to behold the
    marvelous wealth of Stavoren with his own eyes, and
    now that he had penetrated into this merchant’s
    house, he felt he had been amply rewarded.</p>

    <p>The merchant’s wife, not impervious to flattery,
    requested the traveler to be seated and to partake
    of the banquet as her unbidden but welcome guest.
    He accepted the invitation in part, but asked, according
    to the custom of the Orient whence he came,
    for nothing but some bread and salt. Servants
    were dispatched to bring both, but returned, saying
    that no such simple articles of food could
    be found in the house. Thereupon the stranger,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>without further word, ate of the costly and unfamiliar
    dishes prepared for the banquet.</p>

    <p>After the feast he told of his travels, he expatiated
    upon the successes and the failures of his life, he
    discoursed with much eloquent verbiage upon the
    instability of earthly fortunes, and he prognosticated
    the ultimate fall of wealth and splendor. His hostess
    became offended, not only because of his contumelious
    belittling the value of riches in her presence
    and before her guests, but because he had failed
    thus far to compliment her upon her personal beauty
    and the luxuries to be found in her home. Before
    he took his leave he mollified his views to this extent:
    “O gracious lady,” he said, “marvelous indeed is your
    home and fit for a queen; if you traveled far and
    near you could not find its equal. But, my lady,
    among your treasures I miss one thing, and that is
    the noblest that all the earth produces.” He departed
    forthwith, leaving the gathering in a state of
    perplexity.</p>

    <p>To please the whim of his wife, the merchant dispatched
    a fleet of ships to cruise the world until it
    should find “The noblest thing that all the earth
    produces,” whereupon the fleet’s commander should
    fill the hulls and cover the decks with it and bring
    it to Stavoren. For months the ships sailed about,
    touching at one port and then at another, blindly
    searching for this most costly of all treasures.</p>

    <p>One day a heavy sea came over one of the ships,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>flooding the ’tween decks and spoiling the provisions.
    The crew became in need of bread, but there was
    no flour with which to bake it. The men grew
    mutinous. The captain saw that neither gold nor
    silks nor precious jewels could outweigh the value
    of bread, and the occurrence led him to believe that
    bread was the most expensive thing in the world.
    He reported the matter to the commander, who
    agreed with his specious argument, and the whole
    fleet hurried to the nearest port, which happened to
    be Danzig. They loaded the vessels with the finest
    wheat, and set sail direct for Stavoren.</p>

    <p>When the merchant’s wife heard of the nature
    of the cargo the fleet had brought home, she ordered
    the wheat thrown into the sea. The poor of the town
    begged and implored, stormed and reproached, but
    of no avail; the order of the woman was executed
    to the letter.</p>

    <p>By and by myriads of blades of grainless wheat
    commenced to appear above the surface of the water.
    Their stocks and roots collected the sand as it was
    washed up by the tides of the German ocean, forming
    a great sand dune that blocked the port so that
    vessels could neither enter nor leave. The inhabitants
    of the place were suddenly brought face to
    face with the fact that commerce, the source of their
    wealth, had to be abandoned. Poverty and want
    reigned where riches ruled before. The wife of the
    once wealthy merchant wandered about from village
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>to village, begging the bread which no one who had
    heard of her improvidence would give her. She suffered
    death from utter starvation. Then one night
    the sea began to boom and, bursting over the dunes,
    buried the town forever.</p>

    <p>To this day the more superstitious of the fisher-folk
    who ply their vocation along that coast of the
    Zuyder Zee talk of the wonderful sunken city of
    Stavoren and how its pinnacles and palaces at the
    bottom glitter up through the pellucid waters under
    the rays of a summer’s sun.</p>

    <span class="chap_name">Friesland and Its Capital</span></h2>


    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Leeuwarden</span> is the most important town in
    Friesland; therefore its capital. Also it is the
    only place in the province that is really worth a
    protracted visit. On the way from Stavoren you
    may wander up the coast a short distance to Hindeloopen,
    once famed for its highly decorated furniture
    and the many-colored costumes of its natives; you
    may stop off at Sneek and see its <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">stadthuis</i> and its
    <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">waterpoort</i>, better examples of which you will have
    already seen in North Holland; you may journey
    over to the coast town of Harlingen&mdash;a much less
    interesting fishing port than Volendam&mdash;breaking
    the trip at Franeker to see the wonderfully ingenious
    astronomical model of the workings of the solar system
    which took one of the more inventive citizens
    of the place, Eise Eisenga by name, seven years to
    construct; but all of these especial features, and
    more, can be seen and studied in Leeuwarden.</p>

    <p>When you enter the interior of Friesland you will
    be penetrating one of the three or four provinces
    of Holland that are not overrun with tourists.
    Even in its capital an American is more or less of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>a curiosity and he may expect to be stared
    at until the people stumble over each other, almost,
    in their well-meaning efforts to divine his nationality;
    but he may console himself in the thought that they
    will be just as curious, if not as humorous, to him
    as he is to them.</p>

    <p>Before the time of the terrific geographical convulsion
    responsible for the formation of the Zuyder
    Zee, there had been but one Friesland, stretching
    over much of the entire territory later known as that
    of the Dutch Republic, including Holland. Its inhabitants,
    the Frisians, were renowned throughout
    Europe for their physical prowess. Imbued with an
    unquenchable love for political independence, they
    had shaken off the yokes of the imperial counts and
    had formed the league of the seven “Sea Lands” in
    the eleventh century. After being subjugated for
    a time by Charlemagne, they suddenly rebelled, and
    in 1256 defeated and put to death the German king,
    William <abbr title="2">II</abbr> of Holland. When the German ocean
    rolled in over the land, engulfing considerably more
    than a thousand Frisian villages, it separated kindred
    peoples, creating not only a geographical but a political
    chasm between them. West Friesland became
    absorbed in Holland, but East Friesland continued
    its career as a confederation of independently governed
    maritime provinces, until Saxony, hard pressed
    for funds, sold its sovereignty to the house of Austria
    for a paltry 350,000 crowns.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>
    <p>Then Charles <abbr title="5">V</abbr>, Count of Holland, Emperor of
    Germany, King of Jerusalem, Sicily, and Spain,
    Duke of Milan, dominator of much in Asia and
    Africa and “autocrat of half the world,” established
    his predatorial authority, and “this little country,
    whose statutes proclaimed her to be ‘free as the
    wind as long as it blew,’ whose institutions Charlemagne
    had honored and left unmolested, who had
    freed herself with ready poniard from Norman tyranny,
    who had never bowed her neck to feudal chieftain,
    nor to the papal yoke,” finally forfeited her
    independent existence. Her peoples are the only
    Germanic tribe that have preserved an unaltered
    nomenclature since the time of the Romans; they
    will be Frisians to-morrow, as they were the day
    before yesterday.</p>

    <p>The most prominent and characteristic feature of
    the Frisian costume is the headdress of its women&mdash;in
    fact, it is the only one extant worthy of any
    notice whatever, for the remainder of the make-up,
    not only of the men but of the women also, is commonplace
    and unattractive. This headdress consists
    of a kind of metal skullcap, as often made of gold
    as of silver, fitting closely at the temples and embellished
    at these points with a pair of spiral ornaments.
    Over this is worn a cap of white or light
    blue lace, having a so-called “tail piece” dangling
    down the back of the neck like the scoop of a fireman’s
    helmet. On top of all this, many of the women&mdash;as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>if their violent efforts to adapt the modern were
    wrestling with a series of sturdy determinations to
    retain the antique&mdash;will crown the sublime with the
    ridiculous by wearing an old-fashioned black “poke
    bonnet,” with the strings tied in a bow under the
    chin. These gold and silver head-pieces are handed
    down from one generation to another, and the gold
    ones, especially, are expensive; but that item does
    not curb the desire and ambition of every mother’s
    daughter in Friesland to own one, where the usual
    heirloom has not been forthcoming.</p>

    <p>An admirable collection showing the evolution of
    the Frisian metal skull plate is on view in the Frisian
    Museum in Leeuwarden. Adapted first as a kind of
    hair ornament of two coin-sized flat pieces connected
    simply by a thin wire, its size developed gradually
    until the two small termini became consolidated into
    a single large one that covered the entire head of
    the wearer. The latest specimen in the Museum is
    decorated in front with a diamond-studded brooch,
    the whole costing in the neighborhood of $1,200.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_168.jpg" alt="" width="437" height="400" />
    <p class="center">Leeuwarden’s structural curiosity is the Olde-Hove,
    an unfinished church tower of brick, leaning with all the abandon of
    Pisa’s Tower</p>
    </div>

    <p>The Frisian Museum in Leeuwarden contains also
    about the most valuable and comprehensive collection
    of old Delft, Chinese, and Japanese ware in Holland,
    tastefully cabineted in one of the large rooms on the
    ground floor. To the connoisseur in such matters
    this room is a treat that cannot be overlooked with
    impunity, for the character of its contents is unparalleled
    and its value indeterminable. Shelf after
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>shelf there are of the most delicately tinted tea
    sets and table services, vases and urns of every description,
    and the wooden columns that support the
    floor above are hung with graduated festoons of
    plates and saucers, so that it would take the greater
    part of a week to inspect them all.</p>

    <p>On the second floor are a number of tiled rooms
    furnished in authentic sixteenth and seventeenth century
    style, even to the sleeping bunks in the walls
    and the miniature ladders that once assisted in climbing
    into them. The models of these and most of their
    furnishings were found in Hindeloopen. To increase
    the realistic effect of these apartments the authorities
    have introduced groups of three or four stuffed
    figures attired in the costumes of the period, posed
    in front of the fireplace or about a center table, but
    they are so stiff and ludicrous-looking that they might
    well be dispensed with, and their costumes shown to
    better effect behind the glass of a cabinet. In the
    basement can be seen a few rooms finished and outfitted
    with the domestic and culinary implements of
    the same centuries.</p>

    <p>In addition to all these there are two adjoining
    rooms on the second floor of the Museum containing
    old furniture and decorations bequeathed to the State
    by the artist Bisschop. The most conspicuous object
    in one of these rooms is an immense cabinet of
    beautifully carved oak, black and glossy with age,
    that would excite the envy of any lover of the antique.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>Built in 1610, it was purchased thirty-five years ago
    by Bisschop for something like twelve or fifteen dollars;
    to-day it has a valuation of $2,000. On its
    top stand two pieces of old Delft for which the artist
    originally gave as little as ten gulden.</p>

    <p>The remaining rooms of the Museum contain collections
    of Roman and Frisian coins and medals,
    Roman curiosities found in the neighborhood, fine old
    silver plate and flagons, remarkably carved ivory
    hunting horns, and, since the early Frisians were
    alleged by some to be the first pipe smokers in Europe,
    an instructive conglomeration of pipes and
    tobacco pouches and all the accessory appurtenances
    necessary to the full enjoyment of the weed.</p>

    <p>The Chancellerie, a large building just around the
    corner from the Museum, erected in the reign of
    Philip <abbr title="2">II</abbr> and used originally as a law court, still
    serves the government by housing the national
    archives and the provincial library. With its handsome
    Gothic façade, this building is Friesland’s architectural
    masterpiece and one of the best preserved
    of ancient buildings in all Holland. In forceful
    contrast to it is Leeuwarden’s structural curiosity,
    an unfinished church tower of brick, called the Olde-Hove,
    one hundred and thirty feet in height and
    marking the western boundary of the city proper.
    Just when it will take it into its head to topple over
    is a problem of uncertain solution, but, judging from
    this Dutch Leaning Tower of Pisa’s utter disregard
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>for the perpendicular, it looks as though it might
    bury a part of Leeuwarden’s pretty park under its
    débris almost any minute.</p>

    <p>The city of Leeuwarden is entirely surrounded by
    the cobra-like coil of a wide canal, the quays of which
    afford loading and unloading facilities for the many
    boats that ply to and from Leeuwarden from and to
    almost every point in Holland. Along the north
    and west edges of this canal on the town side they
    have planted lawns and flower beds on the site of the
    old city bastions. And, speaking about flower beds,
    the largest geraniums I think I ever saw were growing
    in a little plot near the station in Leeuwarden;
    each cluster of blossoms seemed as great in diameter
    as the head of a small cabbage. Friesland is also
    the land of begonias, but in Groningen the plants
    seem to bear a larger flower than they do in Leeuwarden.</p>

    <p>Distant as it is from the great centers of Dutch
    life and activity, Leeuwarden seems of more recent
    vintage than any city of its size you will have seen
    so far in the Netherlands; its types are fewer than
    in almost any town on the other side of the Zuyder
    Zee and its old buildings and churches are less numerous.
    Most of the former they have adapted to modern
    usage, and even the old weigh-house that stands
    severely alone beside the canal in the Waagsplein
    has been turned into a fire station. The canal that
    sweeps through the town from west to east is lined
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>where the space permits with little colonies of shops
    on wheels, built of corrugated iron and capable of
    being closed at night against the mischievous pranks
    of young Holland&mdash;peripatetic shopping and marketing
    districts, offering anything and everything for
    sale that may be found in the permanent stores.</p>

    <p>Hotel accommodations, however, are more provincial.
    In the dining-room everyone is seated at one
    long table, as in the smaller hotels in The Hague,
    so that an ordinary mealtime looks more like a banquet.
    The business and social phases of the hotel
    are conducted in one large room wherein the men
    gather after dinner to sit and smoke, read, or play
    chess. Here in a corner at a little desk holds forth
    the head waiter. Although he is the functionary who
    assigns you to your room and to whom you pay your
    bill, he is not so preëminent as the head waiters
    of most of the hotels in the south, for the proprietor
    usually shows a preference to manage the place according
    to his own ideas. As a general rule he will
    do his own marketing and, if conditions require it,
    he is not above helping to wait upon the table and
    making himself useful in many other ways.</p>

    <p>Not far from Leeuwarden, in the village of Dronrijp,
    was born, in 1836, one of Holland’s most eminent
    modern artists, although a naturalized subject
    of Great Britain since 1873&mdash;Sir Laurens Alma
    Tadema, some noted examples of whose work are to
    be seen in the Mesdag Museum in The Hague.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
    <p>Another town, Marssum, a few miles distant, is
    famous as the center of the cattle district, and dealers
    and breeders come to some of the large farms in the
    vicinity from all over the world, including America,
    to purchase blooded Frisian stock. Indeed, all along
    the thirty-three miles of railway between Leeuwarden
    and Groningen the pastures are dotted with
    fine, healthy-looking black and white cows. Each
    field being surrounded by a small canal eight or
    ten feet in width, the cattle may be segregated, one
    herd from another, by simply closing the gates on top
    of the narrow hills that lead across the intervening
    canal from one pasture to its neighbor; thus the labor
    and expense of building fences is saved. As much
    as North Holland is noted for its cheese, just so much
    is Friesland famed for its butter, and between 130,000,000
    and 140,000,000 pounds of it are churned
    annually. The conditions of the trade are exceptionally
    sanitary and at all times under government
    inspection.</p>

    <p>Here and there through Friesland&mdash;in fact,
    through almost any part of the Netherlands&mdash;you
    will see a high wooden tripod topped with the usual
    cartload of débris that constitutes a stork’s nest;
    for the stork, be it remembered, is the national bird
    of Holland, and if the farmhouse offers no suitable
    place, such as a chimney pot, for example, for the
    stork to build its summer home, the farmer is wont
    to court the luck that a nesting stork about the place
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>is thought to be sure to bring, and builds a nesting
    place for it.</p>

    <p>They wend their migratory way northward, these
    storks, from the interior of Africa near the sources
    of the Nile, and make their appearance in Holland
    contemporaneous with the first signs of approaching
    spring. Their coming is regarded as a veritable
    Godsend by the Netherlander and the various Dutch
    journals feature the “stories” of first reported
    arrivals, and devote to them an amount of space commensurate
    with the importance of the event, while
    any decrease in the numbers of the birds is quickly
    observed and promptly linotyped.</p>

    <p>When the storks, so high in the air that they
    appear as mere specks, approach the familiar scenes
    and nesting places of previous summers, they descend
    to the earth in pairs to hunt about for their old
    abodes. Having finally discovered these, a deal of
    repairing will have to be done to render them once
    more habitable. Both the male and the female labor
    with a great deal of energy and no little resourcefulness
    in the reconstruction of the old nest,
    collecting sticks and twigs, and weaving them together
    with much mathematical precision. Endowed
    with no vocal power of calling each other or criticising
    their work, their silence while at the task is punctuated
    only with a comical snapping of bill and a
    suggestive flapping of wings. If a certain pair has
    been a little premature, perhaps, and chosen, not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>always by mistake, another pair’s nest, the ensuing
    imbroglio often results in such a complete destruction
    of the point at issue that both pairs instead of one
    must build anew.</p>

    <p>The story of the “Stork’s Judgment” is one of
    the best known among the Dutch with regard to these
    birds. It is that in the fall, prior to the departure
    of the storks for southern climes, all the old and
    decrepit ones, too weakly to stand the long trip, are
    killed off so that the general migration may not be
    delayed or impeded. Another belief held by the
    Hollander, more or less a child of the imagination
    but not without at least a tinge of fact, is that among
    the stork communities a certain number of picked
    birds are detailed each season to act in the capacity
    of a regular police force to preserve the peace and
    protect the interests of the colony at large.</p>

    <p>A stork’s nest on the roof serves, according to the
    superstitions of many Dutch farmers, as a prevention
    to the ravages of lightning and the contraction of
    contagious diseases by their families. Misfortune in
    some form or other is sure to follow if the stork does
    not see fit to nest somewhere near the house, and
    simply because of this, land holders have been known
    to pack up, bag, baggage, and agricultural implements,
    and move into another district.</p>

    <h2 title="XIII The Hinterland of Holland">XIII<br />
    <span class="chap_name">The Hinterland of Holland</span></h2>


    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">If</span> Friesland be considered the frontier of Holland’s
    tourist territory, the provinces of Groningen,
    Drenthe, and Over-Yssel certainly constitute its
    hinterland.</p>

    <p>With the exception of one or two towns they lack
    the symmetry of scenery, the quaintness of costumes,
    the masterpieces of art that adapt the provinces
    west of the Zuyder Zee to intensive sight-seeing, so
    to speak, while their peoples differ in manner so
    much from those in the west that you seem to be
    traveling through another country altogether. Old
    buildings they have in plenty, and rural and urban
    beauty spots may be discovered here and there, but
    taken by and large, they offer fewer attractions for
    and cater less to the invasion of the tourist than any
    portion of Holland.</p>

    <p>For the above reason, in planning a trip through
    this land of the brave and the home of the sea,
    it might be well, if practicable, to tap these three
    provinces at the beginning, embellishing first impressions
    by reversing the time-honored route and returning,
    instead of advancing, through North and South
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>Holland, Utrecht, North Brabant, and Zeeland, and
    spending a profitable day at least on the Island of
    Walcheren as a kind of tasteful cordial after the
    seven course tour.</p>

    <p>Groningen, the capital of the province of the same
    name, shares the distinction with Leyden and Utrecht
    in being one of the three university towns in Holland.
    Although twice as large as Leeuwarden, it is barely
    half as interesting. It seems, too, a vastly more
    modern place, with its trolley service, its large
    assortment of wide streets, its apparent dearth of
    silent canals, while its narrow, busy Heerestraat
    emulates the examples set by the Kalverstraat in
    Amsterdam and the Spuistraat in The Hague.</p>

    <p>Its university, established in 1614, is attended by
    half a thousand students, and has within recent
    years moved into more commodious and modern
    quarters in the form of an appropriate and handsome
    building erected in 1850. Among the treasures
    of its library, housed in a separate building, is to be
    found a copy of the revised New Testament by
    Erasmus, bearing marginal annotations in the handwriting
    of Martin Luther. This much for learning.
    With respect to art, Groningen is the birthplace of
    two of Holland’s best known modern painters, H. W.
    Mesdag and Josef Israels, the latter being especially
    distinguished for his ability to record upon canvas
    the sadder aspects of humble life. At the advanced
    age of eighty-seven this master of his craft died
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>during the past summer in The Hague, where he had
    resided for a number of years.</p>

    <p>At the foot of the tower of the church of St.
    Martin on the edge of the market square stands the
    old <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">regthuis</i>, a small brick building of early sixteenth
    century erection, lately restored and put into use as
    a guardhouse. With its green and white shutters
    of diamond design it looks strangely out of place
    as the opponent of a building of such conglomerate
    architecture as the columned <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">stadthuis</i>, on the western
    side of the square. Grain being one of the
    staple commodities of the place, one end of the
    <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">visch-markt</i> is bounded by the corn exchange. Behind
    this stands the Aa-Kerk, of Gothic construction
    and thirteenth century origin. And, as is the habit
    with many of the towns in this section of Holland,
    Groningen has made the most of the site of her old
    ramparts and city fortifications by transforming it
    into a public park.</p>

    <p>Without the least savor of favoritism, Groningen
    might easily capture the palm for supporting about
    the most uninteresting market in Holland. Held in
    the great square that serves the town as a center for
    outdoor business transactions and trolley service, it
    is a market of everything and a market of nothing.
    It looks as if all the shopkeepers had put up tents
    and transferred their stock from their shops to the
    street. Here they sell anything from cucumbers to
    cocoanuts, from stepladders to safety matches&mdash;a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>nondescript assortment of edibles, cooking utensils,
    secondhand clothing, cheap crockery, old books, and
    umbrellas. There are no types to speak of, and the
    place reeks with the essence of small and insignificant
    bargaining. The hotel at which I registered in
    Groningen was centrally located&mdash;too centrally, in
    fact&mdash;on the market square. Just in front along the
    curb a purveyor of dried fish held forth in his tent.
    The breeze was blowing gently, and the hotel stood
    to the leeward of the dried fish purveyor. As Sam
    Bernard would say, “Sufficiency!”</p>

    <p>The railway line from Groningen down through
    Assen and Meppel to Zwolle penetrates a flat, barren,
    unattractive-looking country which, in places, might
    be mistaken for the “meadows” near Atlantic City.
    The roadbed of the railway itself is the worst in the
    world&mdash;at least I <i>think</i> it is the worst in the world,
    although the allegation may arouse the envy of one
    or two Mexican roadbeds that I am no longer on
    speaking terms with, each of which claims the same
    distinction. The engineers who were responsible for
    this piece of track, through a perfectly flat country
    with no curves or grades to cope with, could hardly
    have done much worse. It is even beyond the powers
    of the imagination how they contrived to make it as
    bad as it is. Its construction reminds one vaguely
    of the story of the “jealous pie,” whose top and
    lower crusts grew jealous of each other for fear
    something might come between them. So with this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
    railway. If one rail bulges outward a little the
    other rail bulges inward sympathetically. And
    it is fortunate that they are so attached to each
    other, because if one rail bulged outward and the
    other rail likewise bulged outward at the same point
    we might not be here to tell of it.</p>

    <p>Neither is the tediousness of the two-hour ride
    relieved at all by the congeniality of one’s traveling
    companions. For the information of the prospective
    tourist through Holland it might be well to state in
    this connection that smoking is only forbidden in
    those few and far-between compartments of the railway
    carriage marked “<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Niet Rooken</i>.” In all others,
    whether labeled “<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Rooken</i>” or not, whether occupied
    by men, women, or children, smoking is not only permitted
    but encouraged; and however vigorous and
    healthy a Hollander may be, his one weak point is
    his aversion to ventilation. In this matter he may
    be likened to the elephant afraid of a mouse. Consequently,
    the first move he makes when he enters the
    compartment is to close both windows. If he lacks
    the boorishness to reach over deliberately and try to
    curtail <i>your</i> supply of fresh air, which is not often,
    he will huddle himself in a corner as far from the
    offending draft as possible, and eye you up and down
    for your failure to appreciate his position.</p>

    <p class="center">The Town Hall and market square in Groningen, where one
    may buy anything, from cucumbers to stepladders</p>
    </div>

    <p>For the full distance from Groningen to Zwolle I
    traveled in the same compartment with three of the
    most rabid stale air agitators I have ever run afoul
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>of. To make matters worse, one was highly perfumed
    with a mixture of musk and mint, and wore
    the nails of his little fingers long&mdash;half an inch would
    not be an exaggeration&mdash;as some sort of a mark of
    caste, possibly borrowed from the Chinese. During
    the trip they tried to make things as blithe and agreeable
    for me as possible&mdash;although with the opposite
    intent, judging from several remarks which I finally
    succeeded in translating&mdash;by giving a variety of imitations
    of various barnyard animals because I guarded
    one open window with my life.</p>

    <p>All through the province of Drenthe the sources
    of another industry in which little Holland is preëminent
    may be seen from the car windows&mdash;the
    great peat bogs. Upon peat the Dutch housewife
    must rely for her fuel, for the coal mines in the
    Netherlands are next thing to null and void; so the
    preparation of peat has become at once an art and
    an industry. Towns and hamlets are named for it&mdash;“<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">veen</i>”
    with an appropriate prefix. It is as indigent
    to Holland as the wild turkey to the mountains
    of Virginia. But, instead of striving to eliminate
    as quickly as possible a very essential natural resource,
    the Dutch have developed the scientific cultivation
    of peat and made the vast bogs into almost
    inexhaustible producers of fuel.</p>

    <p>The lighter, more fibrous peat, <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">laagveen</i>, in Dutch&mdash;found
    several feet in thickness in the eastern part
    of Groningen, all through Drenthe, and even stretching
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>well across the German border&mdash;is contrasted
    with the dry peat, or <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">hoogeveen</i>, underlying a thick
    layer of clay. In the case of the latter, the layer
    of clay is removed carefully, the peat is dredged from
    under it, and what water remains is drained off.
    The peat is then spread upon the ground and worked
    by foot pressure until the process, assisted by exposure
    to the sun, brings it to a certain consistency.
    It is then cut into convenient lengths, stacked, and
    allowed to dry. In the meantime the layer of clay
    has been mixed with sand, replaced, and planted with
    crops. With respect to the bog peat, the fen is first
    surrounded with a canal for drainage purposes; also
    the plant putrefaction is assisted by successive reformations
    of soil from city refuse, laden with which
    the peat boats return to the fens.</p>

    <p>The bait with which Assen, the capital of the
    province of Drenthe, should lure the tourist to stop
    off, if only between trains, is the church of an ancient
    nunnery suppressed during the Reformation. This
    relic, with a fragment of the old cloisters still attached
    to it, has been transformed into Assen’s Town Hall,
    and forms a part of the adjoining provincial offices
    erected on the site of the nunnery. The great tumuli,
    or so-called “giants’ caves,” within half an
    hour’s drive from Assen, and marked with huge
    boulders borne down by the glaciers from Scandinavia,
    are of interest more to the profound archeologist
    than to the ordinary sight-seer.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
    <p>Meppel, farther down, is a peat town of no artistic
    or historical importance, although it is the junction
    of the peat and the butter routes through the hinterland.
    From it the traveler may journey up through
    the butter district direct to Leeuwarden, or he may
    break through the peat country on another line to
    Groningen.</p>

    <p>Zwolle, the first stop below Meppel, is an attractive
    town, but with fewer types even than Groningen.
    Here the familiar windmills and wooden shoes begin
    to diminish perceptibly in numbers. With its 32,000
    inhabitants, Zwolle is but a shade smaller than Leeuwarden.
    It is the capital of the province of Over-Yssel
    and was the birthplace of Gerard Terburg, one
    of Holland’s celebrated seventeenth century wielders
    of the brush and crayon. But like too many other
    towns in the Netherlands, Zwolle has been so short-sighted
    and so remiss in her duty that she has failed
    to preserve for public appreciation a single example
    of the work of her most famous son.</p>

    <p>The most striking architectural feature of the
    town is her old Sassen-Poort, or Saxon gateway, the
    five Gothic spires of which tend to relieve any
    monotony of city skyline. It stands but a short distance
    from the station, framed behind a green mat
    of trees that lends a pleasant contrast to its diamond
    window shutters of delicate blue and spotless white.
    The modern stone bridge across the canal just in
    front, although forming rather an inappropriate
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>approach to the old tower, is one of the most artistic
    in all Holland.</p>

    <p>Upon a certain warm, sunlit morning I crossed
    this bridge and turned down along the canal, following
    one of the many labyrinthian pathways under
    the spreading trees. Soon I came upon what anyone
    on not too familiar terms with the customs of the
    country might have supposed to be a public café.
    It was neither fenced nor hedged in, and the path I
    was following led straight as a die to its low, broad
    veranda, carpeted and freely sprinkled with comfortable
    wicker chairs. Little round tables were scattered
    here and there, and I concluded that the place
    lacked nothing for the enjoyment of a glass of liquid
    refreshment.</p>

    <p>Accordingly, I followed the course of least resistance,
    and presently found myself reclining deeply
    and luxuriously in one of the wicker armchairs on
    the veranda.</p>

    <p>After a short struggle, my thirst overcame my
    lethargy, and I summoned enough energy to push a
    convenient electric button.</p>

    <p>No response.</p>

    <p>A second, and then a third push at the button.</p>

    <p>Still no response.</p>

    <p>As a drastic last resort, I arose with no little
    effort, and wended my angry way into the building
    to ascertain the cause for such delinquent service.</p>

    <p>I was approached by a gentleman who, having
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>observed my impatience, had come to my rescue from
    his little secluded corner in the reading room.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_184.jpg" alt="" width="407" height="400" />
    <p class="center">The best of Kampen’s gateways, of which architectural
    features the town originally possessed seven</p>
    </div>

    <p>In my very best Dutch&mdash;my vocabulary consists
    of some three or four words&mdash;I asked the gentleman
    where on earth the waiter might be in hiding. In
    his very best English the gentleman replied politely
    that the place was a private club and not a public
    grogshop. Whereupon, I could have accomplished
    an exit through any convenient keyhole without the
    least pinching.</p>

    <p>Near Zwolle, in a monastery on the Agnetenberg,
    reached after a drive of three or four miles from the
    town, lived and died Thomas à Kempis, the author
    of “<cite class="plain">The Imitation of Christ</cite>”&mdash;a work that has been
    translated into almost every tongue.</p>

    <p>A short ride in the train from Zwolle brings you
    to Kampen, on the broad Yssel at its point of
    discharge into the Zuyder Zee. It is Holland’s
    home town of ancient gateways, no less than three
    of which, leading out into the park that has superseded
    the old fortifications, are in excellent state of
    preservation and worthy of study from an architectural
    point of view. Originally the town possessed
    seven of these gates, and there might have
    been fourteen, had the City Council listened to a
    learned one of its members who arose at a certain
    meeting and proposed that they double the original
    number; for, he argued, had not each of the seven
    gates contributed its 10,000,000 florins a year to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>town treasury in the shape of taxes upon merchandise
    and produce passing through it? Therefore, it
    would be a simple matter to double the town’s revenue,
    for all they had to do was to double the number
    of gates.</p>

    <p>But the rank and file of tourists that include
    Kampen in their itineraries come to view its Town
    Hall, a venerable building erected in the fourteenth
    century, restored after a devastating fire in 1543,
    and which may be numbered to-day among the most
    characteristic curiosities in the Netherlands. Among
    the features of its Gothic façade are six statues in
    stone, dating from the original building. From left
    to right these may be recognized as the effigies of
    Charlemagne and Alexander the Great and the characterizations
    of Moderation, Fidelity, Justice, and
    Neighborly Love. One of the windows of the weather-stained
    edifice still remains trellised with iron as in
    the days of Kampen’s olden time importance. The
    interior contains a medieval council room with magistrates’
    seats of oak, handsomely carved, and a
    gigantic chimney piece, unfortunately overladen with
    ornaments.</p>

    <p>Kampen stripped of its gateways and its Town
    Hall would scarcely be worth the time spent to reach
    it. The town itself seems to be given up to small manufacturing
    establishments, and its people made up of
    the class that keeps them in operation. But the
    fine architectural relics of its earlier days raise its
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>instructive power to as high a degree as that of
    any town now within Holland’s tourist area.</p>

    <p>From Kampen you may take a steamer out across
    the Zuyder Zee to the Island of Urk, inhabited by
    a colony of daring fishermen who are less spoiled,
    yet whose costumes and customs are less interesting,
    than those of the people of Marken. But you will
    have to hurry if you wish to pay it a visit, for
    Urk will soon go the way of Schokland, an island
    nearer to Kampen, the habitation of which has recently
    been forbidden by the government on account
    of the imminent prospects of total encroachment by
    the sea. To-day Urk is tussling for life with every
    tide; it may be merely a question of months, perhaps
    of weeks or days, before its people will be compelled
    to give up their homes and move to the less dangerous
    mainland.</p>

    <p>Eighteen and a half miles south of Zwolle, still
    on the river Yssel, and just across the frontier of
    Gelderland, lies Deventer, noted commercially for a
    rather incongruous assortment of enterprises: iron,
    carpets, and honey cakes. A weigh-house, abnormally
    large for a town of Deventer’s size, having a
    great flight of steps ascending to its entrance from
    the Brink, the principal square of the town, has been
    converted into a gymnasium. Also facing the Brink
    are several handsome private houses of seventeenth
    century erection. Deventer, strange to say, seems to
    be most athletically inclined; it maintains no less than
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>fifty different association football clubs, which strive
    with each other for the title of champion on the
    many athletic fields along the banks of the Yssel.</p>

    <p>After years of study in Spain and other foreign
    lands, after a lengthy residence in Haarlem, and his
    experiences in the studio as co-worker with Franz
    Hals, to Deventer came Gerard Terburg, where he
    finally settled down and where he died in 1681 at the
    age of sixty-four. Unlike Rembrandt, Hals Holbein,
    and Jan Steen, Terburg took a lively interest in public
    and municipal affairs, and in his later years he served
    his adopted city as Burgomaster.</p>

    <span class="chap_name">Gelderland</span></h2>


    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">From</span> Deventer to Apeldoorn is simply a matter
    of a quarter of an hour in a railway carriage
    which now darts past so many fields of grain,
    now past so many fine old woods and terraced summer
    homes that the effect upon the tourist is kaleidoscopic&mdash;like
    being shot through a Christmas wreath.</p>

    <p>Apeldoorn is a beautiful little city, very much unlike
    what might be expected of Holland, since its
    canals are few and its windmills at a premium. Its
    streets remind one more of those of an English village.
    Its outskirts and environs are freely sprinkled with
    attractive country homes and villas belonging to
    that class of Hollanders that passes its time, for one
    purpose or another, hovering in the neighborhood of
    royalty, for near by at Het Loo the Queen is wont
    to summer. The town’s two parks, named appropriately
    Oranje and Wilhelmina, present effects in landscape
    gardening incomparable with those of almost
    any other parks in Holland, and the broad avenues
    that lead out to Her Majesty’s palace are barely
    surpassed in beauty even by the Old Way from The
    Hague to Scheveningen. Like the spokes of a wheel
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>their shaded roadways stretch straight as a die, with
    the palace of Het Loo as their common hub.</p>

    <p><em>Pensions</em> and private villas are as thick in and
    about Apeldoorn as seventeen-year locusts. Each
    has its velvety lawn; each its variegated flower garden.
    Apparently the town boasts of everything to
    make the lives of its summer residents one blissful
    dream of being some day bidden to dinner or tea
    at the dazzling white palace at the end of the avenue.
    I imagine the sanitary arrangements of some of
    the summer homes of these pseudo patrons of royalty
    must be primitive in the extreme. This may or may
    not be a criterion by which to judge the others, but,
    as I drove by the estate of one of Apeldoorn’s nabobs,
    a maidservant appeared upon the second-story balcony
    and emptied the contents of a pocket folding
    rubber bath tub full upon the lawn in front&mdash;anything
    but a discreet exhibition, to say the least
    about it.</p>

    <p>Het Loo, or The Grove, was the favorite palace of
    Wilhelmina’s father, William <abbr title="3">III</abbr>, and of his grandfather,
    William <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, the first King of the Netherlands.
    A steam tram operates upon rather uncertain schedule
    between the railway station at Apeldoorn and
    Het Loo, but a much more pleasant method of consuming
    the time, if only between trains, is to drive
    by carriage out the long avenue, returning through
    the parks of Apeldoorn.</p>

    <p>The peasants of the surrounding country are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>of purely agricultural proclivities, and their land
    seems more like real farm land than the lower level
    portions of the Netherlands. Apeldoorn itself lies
    in the district known as the Veluwe, a territory between
    the Yssel and the Zuyder Zee, in places as
    much as three hundred feet above the level of the
    ocean and, with few exceptions, the highest in Holland.
    Parts of it, however, are so sandy and sterile
    that the ground is available after complete fertilization
    mainly for the cultivation of tobacco.</p>

    <p>Zutphen, a few miles below Apeldoorn, was the
    first city in the east to offer any speakable resistance
    against the Spaniards during the war of independence,
    and there still stands the gateway, called the Nieuwstadtspoort,
    through which Don Frederic of Toledo,
    the son of the notorious Duke of Alva, forced an
    entrance into the town on the 16th day of November,
    1572. Mons and Mechlin having been captured
    and promptly sacked, Alva had repaired to Nymwegen,
    leaving Don Frederic to conquer the provinces
    in the north and east&mdash;preferably by force, for
    they were a bloodthirsty lot, those Spaniards. A
    seeming lack of patriotism on the parts of the cities
    which had already submitted, too enthusiastically
    perhaps, to the Spaniards, gave these international
    marauders little excuse to resort to their usual heinous
    methods of effecting subjugation.</p>

    <p>When Zutphen, therefore, offered a feeble and half-hearted
    resistance against the troops of Frederic of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>Toledo, and the fact was reported to his father, the
    commander in chief and arch brigand of the whole
    depredating crew, he promptly sent orders to his son
    to enter the city and kill every man and burn every
    house to the ground. According to Motley, “the
    Duke’s command was almost literally obeyed. Don
    Frederic entered Zutphen, and without a moment’s
    warning put the whole garrison to the sword. The
    citizens next fell a defenseless prey; some being
    stabbed in the streets, some hanged on the trees which
    decorated the city, some stripped stark naked and
    turned out into the fields to freeze to death in the
    wintry night. As the work of death became too
    fatiguing for the butchers, five hundred innocent
    burghers were tied two and two, back to back, and
    drowned like dogs in the river Yssel. A few stragglers
    who had contrived to elude pursuit at first, were
    afterwards taken from their hiding-places and hung
    upon the gallows by their feet, some of which victims
    suffered four days and nights of agony before death
    came to their relief.”</p>

    <p>To-day Zutphen is a quiet old city, very un-Dutch,
    if the expression may be permitted, with many narrow,
    crooked streets and a few canals of varying
    degrees of picturesqueness on its outskirts. Lumber
    is the principal industry of the place, and a great
    deal of poplar wood which goes to supply the wooden
    shoes for many parts of Holland is shipped from
    Zutphen.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>
    <p>Arnhem on the Rhine is the most thriving town
    as well as the capital of Gelderland. It is essentially
    an ancient place, dating back to a remote period in
    the history of the Netherlands; even some there be
    who give Arnhem the credit of being the original
    Arenacum of the Romans. It lies upon the southern
    slopes of the Veluwe district, and from its railway
    station the visitor will actually have to go down hill
    into the town&mdash;a topographical condition so foreign
    to any of the other Dutch cities already visited that
    Arnhem’s allegiance to Holland is questioned at first
    sight.</p>

    <p>Although Arnhem is old, it lacks many of those
    gifts of age that one sees in other old cities throughout
    the country. Its appearance is German, but its
    people, realizing the monetary benefits that rival
    Dutch municipalities are deriving annually from the
    hordes of tourists that descend upon them, try to advertise
    it as typically Dutch, and issue frantic appeals
    to the traveler to be sure to pay it a visit on these
    grounds. With its 60,000 inhabitants it is the sixth
    city in point of population in Holland. Although
    it enjoys every advantage of transportation its commerce
    is pitiable; as a residence city, however, it is
    particularly favored. Because of the attractions of
    its environs, Arnhem is a favorite spot for the retired
    Dutch merchant, who, having amassed a fortune in
    the colonial trade after a long residence in the remote
    Straits Settlements, seeks some quiet place at home
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>endowed with the beauties of nature, in which to spend
    the remainder of his days in comfort.</p>

    <p>The oldest part of Arnhem is the southern end
    of the city, bordering on the Rhine and clustering
    about the Groote Markt as a center. The Groote
    Kerk, an ecclesiastical building of large parts and
    deep excavations, containing numerous monuments
    in memory of various historical celebrities, bounds the
    market square on the west, and on the south one may
    pierce the surrounding buildings to the Eusibius
    Square and the Rhine bank through the ancient Sabil-Poort,
    a Gothic gateway recalling the days when Arnhem
    was fortified with the customary town wall.</p>

    <p>At the side of the Groote Kerk Arnhem holds a
    weekly market which is scarcely more distinctive than
    that of Groningen but so popular with the peasants
    that it overflows into the neighboring streets, and
    places trolley service through the vicinity in a state
    of disruption. Having driven into town the evening
    before, the country people unhitch their horses and
    leave their wagons standing in the square so as to
    lose no time in getting ready for business in the
    morning. Much faith they must have in the honesty
    and orderliness of the citizens of Arnhem, for their
    loads of vegetables and whatever they have for sale
    remain in the open, when the weather is propitious,
    without even a covering.</p>

    <p>A few blocks to the east of the market square lies
    the Eusibiusbinnensingel, a beautiful park-like place,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>but a mouthful to pronounce, with a lake in the
    center surrounded by great shade trees and geometrical
    flower plots. If you follow this to the northward,
    you will come, after a short walk, to the Velperplein,
    the pulse of Arnhem’s trolley traffic, the principal
    feature of which is a large building that goes
    under the poetical name of the Musis Sacrum, containing
    a restaurant and various halls for exhibitions.
    Here at the tables of the open air café the German
    tourists are wont to forgather for refreshment purposes,
    guarding the while their little ten-by-two-inch
    satchels, scarcely large enough to hold half a dozen
    cigars, as if they contained the entire wardrobe and
    family jewels of their owners.</p>

    <p>In the Velperplein one may board an electric car
    for any part of the city and many of its suburbs.
    And it is best to patronize the trolley service of
    Arnhem whenever possible, because taxicabs, horse
    drawn or motor propelled, are not to be found in
    operation. The buccaneering cabbies of Arnhem,
    next of kin to the piratical baggage porters of Fiume,
    charge a goodly price to take you out upon a drive
    in the environs, and double the amount to bring you
    back, on the ground that your ignorance of their
    language, not considering their ignorance of yours,
    was the cause of a misinterpretation of directions.
    And the worst of this tourist bleeding system is that
    the hotel head porters connive with the cabbies.</p>

    <p>On top of a real hill half a mile to the north of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>the railway station is Sonsbeek, a favorite rendezvous
    of the pleasure-seeking Arnhemers, thickly wooded,
    containing a small lake or two, and, of course, the
    inevitable café, while the ascent of a tower called the
    Belvedere is offered as a temptation only to those
    who expect to obtain a magnificent and inspiring view
    where only a mediocre one exists.</p>

    <p>The Velperweg, the Amsterdamschestraatweg&mdash;but
    if this kind of thing goes on it might tangle my type
    into a knotted, inextricable mass; for purely mechanical
    reasons, therefore, I shall revert to an English
    version. The Velper Road, the Amsterdam Road, the
    Zyp Road, the Utrecht Road, and the Apeldoorn
    Road are the five principal arteries that tap the environs
    that have made Arnhem famous with the
    Dutchman. Each one penetrates imposing woods,
    the like of which the Hollander never saw before,
    but ruthlessly tramped almost threadbare by his frequent
    pilgrimages through them in search of a
    “panorama,” no matter how insignificant. At the
    different points where the foliage permits of a view
    of sometimes several miles across the wheat fields,
    fruit venders have set up their stands, the ground is
    littered with papers and the empty boxes discarded
    by many picnickers, and the importunate picture postcard
    man is seen in his element.</p>

    <p class="center">The market at Arnhem, at the side of the Groote Kerk, a
    weekly event that overflows into the neighboring streets and interferes
    with the trolley service</p>
    </div>

    <p>The Velp Road, which leads at length to Zutphen,
    is, perhaps, the gem of all the five. Wide and well
    kept, it is lined on either side as far as the village
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>of Velp, a distance of three miles from Arnhem, with
    handsome residences and tastefully laid out lawns
    and gardens which are girt with small canals in lieu
    of fences, so that each may be admired from the
    roadway.</p>

    <p>Halfway along is Bronbeek, the royal asylum for
    invalid soldiers who have served in the colonial wars.
    It was bought by King William <abbr title="3">III</abbr> in 1854 from its
    private owners, and presented by him to the State five
    years later on condition that it be devoted to its
    present purpose. Little cascades trickle here and
    there through its grounds, while the pair of cannon
    mounted on its front lawn bespeaks its use as no
    blaring signboard could possibly do. Not far from
    the corner entrance to its park stands a statue of
    William <abbr title="2">II</abbr> as Crown Prince, portrayed as carrying
    his arm in a sling after having received a wound in
    the battle of Waterloo. The interior of the building
    contains collections of portraits of East Indian
    heroes, and of weapons, flags, and other trophies of
    war taken in the colonies.</p>

    <p>Rosendaal, one of the largest estates in Gelderland,
    can be reached after a pleasant walk of a mile
    in a northerly direction from Velp. Mentioned for
    the first time as early as 1314, its grounds are still
    kept in a state of baronial magnificence, but of its
    old castle only a comparatively small part of a great
    round tower remains.</p>

    <p>Another walk, but toward the east on the road
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>to the village and wood of Beekhuizen, brings you
    to the castle of Biljoen, erected by Charles, Duke of
    Guelders, in 1530, upon the foundations of an eleventh
    century stronghold.</p>

    <p>Nymwegen may be considered the twin city of Arnhem;
    when one is mentioned the other is instinctively
    thought of. They lie close to each other, are of
    about the same population, offer the same general
    aspects, and have played parts of equal importance
    in the general history of the country; but of the
    two, Nymwegen is possibly the more diverting. It is
    two cities in one&mdash;the older part being purely Dutch,
    with its old Dutch buildings and a few Dutch types
    which are mocked by the declivity of some of its
    streets; the more modern and larger part being distinctively
    German, with its <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">platzes</i>, the general
    distribution and embellishment of its thoroughfares,
    and the density of its greenery. The center of this
    German portion of Nymwegen is the Keiser-Karelplein,
    a beautiful square from which the different
    streets radiate; but what should be the pleasing quiet
    of the neighborhood is constantly and mercilessly
    broken by the shrieks of the engine of a noisy tram
    train that rattles around among the trees as if hunting
    in vain for a convenient exit.</p>

    <p>Yet another example of the very esthetic habit
    that the Dutch have of demolishing old fortifications
    and planting the sites as public pleasure grounds
    may be seen in the Kronenburg Park, the contour of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>whose slopes adds admirably to the general landscape
    effect. Down at the bottom is a duck-dotted lake
    bordered with the benches that constitute the trysting
    places of many a young Nymwegen couple, so unconscious
    of any but their own affairs that they suffer
    old ladies to sit upon the same bench and knit and
    spy with generous eyes upon the lovers’ advances.
    At the farther edge of the lake they have mercifully
    preserved one of the sixteen towers that once strengthened
    the town walls.</p>

    <p>The Waal, one of the many branches of the Rhine,
    is a busier river at Nymwegen than the real Rhine
    is at Arnhem. Tows of long, narrow boats, typical
    of the Rhine above Cologne, ply up and down under
    the great iron railway bridge and lend to the city
    more of a German air than ever.</p>

    <p>Overlooking the river some distance above the railway
    bridge are the shady pleasure grounds of the
    Valkhof, one of the seven hills upon which the city
    of Nymwegen was originally built and where Charlemagne
    erected an imperial palace, later destroyed
    by the French in 1796. An interesting and picturesque
    ruin is a small fragment of the old palace
    church, built by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa,
    while near by may be seen the oldest remnant
    of ecclesiastical architecture in the Netherlands&mdash;the
    sixteen-sided Gothic castle chapel, rebuilt a number
    of times after being consecrated originally by Pope
    Leo <abbr title="3">III</abbr> in 799.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
    <p>Across what must have been the castle moat and
    connected with the Valkhof grounds by an iron
    bridge, a tower of the seventeenth century affords
    the people of Nymwegen an attractive view of which
    they are justly proud, embracing as it does the fertile
    farming districts as far as Cleve, to the southeast,
    as far as Arnhem, to the north, and, upon a clear
    day, as many as four rivers: the Rhine, the Maas, the
    Waal, and the Yssel.</p>

    <p>The old Church of St. Stephen and the brick gateway
    that leads to it from the market square, the
    weigh-house with its red and black shutters, the
    Town Hall, and a number of other old buildings in
    the vicinity of the Groote Markt are all essentially
    Dutch, but for which the visitor might easily imagine
    himself in a German city.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_200.jpg" alt="" width="663" height="400" />
    <p class="center">A feature of Arnhem is the Eusibiusbinnensingel, a
    park-like place with a lake in the center, surrounded by great shade
    trees</p>
    </div>

    <p>With those of Arnhem, however, Nymwegen’s environs
    can scarcely hope to compete. The steam
    tram that rattles around the Keiser-Karelplein
    eventually escapes the city limits and climbs the long
    hill to the Hotel Berg en Dal, from the vicinity of
    which one may look out upon a much vaunted
    “panorama” that might at least be worth while under
    certain conditions. But what with the blatant strummings
    of an automatic piano that considers itself of
    valuable assistance to the complete enjoyment of the
    view, and the petty vibrations of a more or less
    popular photographer intent upon making likenesses
    of visitors in the unusual and startling act of looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
    from the top of a hill in Holland, the view is
    rendered more of a bore than a diversion.</p>

    <p>The Dutch province of Limburg, a narrow tongue
    of land successfully battled for by the Dutch against
    the Belgians in the war of 1830–31, lying away to
    the south of Gelderland and wedged in between Belgium
    on the west and Germany on the east, is so un-Netherlandish,
    both as to peoples and topography,
    that it can scarcely be considered as a part of the
    Holland that the tourist expects. Its inhabitants
    even speak a low German dialect instead of Dutch.
    Furthermore, it is not on any route that a tour
    through Holland might include, for Maastricht, its
    historical old capital, is on the direct railway line
    between Brussels and Cologne and may be more easily
    visited from either of those points than from any
    city in Holland proper.</p>

    <h2 title="CHAPTER XV Utrecht and ’S Hertogenbosch">CHAPTER XV<br />
    <span class="chap_name">Utrecht and ’S Hertogenbosch</span></h2>


    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> can be only one reason for my clearing
    my conscience of Utrecht and ’S Hertogenbosch
    in one and the same chapter. This may or
    may not be apparent to him who has already toured
    Holland, for the two towns cannot be said to be on
    the same line of traffic; they are not even in the
    same province; neither are they alike in appearance.
    Utrecht, the capital of the province of that name,
    with its canals and old houses, its lime avenues and
    its shady parks, has more of the typical Dutch element
    in its make-up, and can be as easily reached,
    and as profitably, from either Rotterdam or Amsterdam.</p>

    <p>’S Hertogenbosch, on the other hand, the frontier
    town of the southern provinces, lies along the route
    that leads into Germany, and its “windmills and
    wooden shoes” are conspicuous in their absence. It
    seems, out of respect for its geographical position,
    more of a Belgian city. Indeed, the Belgians, unable
    to conquer its Dutch nomenclature, long ago rechristened
    the place, and now it is as often spoken
    of by the more euphonious name of Bois le Duc&mdash;a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>merciful convenience for all of my personal purposes,
    because it is as difficult to write ’S Hertogenbosch
    as it is to pronounce it. Since to Bois le Duc
    it has been simplified, Bois le Duc it shall be henceforth
    called within these pages.</p>

    <p>Now to divulge my secret for treating Utrecht and
    Bois le Duc in the same chapter: with their famous
    churches they are the most important ecclesiastical
    cities in Holland. Utrecht, in addition, is a university
    town, a cattle center, and one of the oldest
    places, as well as one of the largest, in the Netherlands.
    In Roman times it was known by the Latin
    translation of “The Ford of the Rhine”&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trajectum
    ad Rhenum</i>. In the seventh century, under the
    Frisians, King Dagobert <abbr title="1">I</abbr> founded here the first
    Frisian church. Subsequently the archbishops of
    Utrecht grew to be the most powerful of medieval
    prelates, and their see at an early date became renowned
    for the magnificence of its houses of worship.
    Utrecht was included in the French province
    of Lorraine, was later annexed to the German empire
    by force of circumstances, and enjoyed the distinction
    of being a favorite residence of the emperors.
    The union of the seven Dutch provinces was
    formed in Utrecht in 1579, under the sponsorship and
    direction of John of Nassau, brother of William,
    Prince of Orange, to establish the independence of
    the Netherlands. From that time on until 1593 the
    States-General assembled here; in that year the seat
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>of the Dutch Government was transferred to The
    Hague. The most celebrated event in the old city’s
    history, however, took place on the 11th of April,
    1713, when the peace was here concluded that terminated
    the Spanish wars of Succession.</p>

    <p>That much for history.</p>

    <p>Twentieth century Utrecht is different. Its old-time
    importance as one of the foremost commercial
    cities of the Middle Ages was owing to its enviable
    position on the Rhine where the river wrenches itself
    into two branches&mdash;the Old Rhine and the Vecht.
    The former percolates, according to the will and
    calculations of the Dutch engineers, into the North
    Sea at Katwyk, and the Vecht empties into the Zuyder
    Zee, near Muiden. The city’s commercial importance
    and activity have dwindled piteously into
    a weekly cattle market held in the Vreeburg, Utrecht’s
    great central square, occupying the site of a castle
    built in 1517 by Emperor Charles <abbr title="5">V</abbr>.</p>

    <p>With the break of day on Saturday the farmers
    from the surrounding country, “<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">klomped</i>” in more
    varied styles of wooden shoes than you will find in
    any other single town in Holland, begin to arrive
    with their stock at the Vreeburg. In the night a
    conglomerate collection of little side-show tents and
    canvas-covered stalls for the sale of almost everything,
    has sprung up like a bed of mushrooms on
    the outskirts of the market place, so that the cattle
    dealer, after he has negotiated a substitution of stock
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>for its equivalent in the coin of the realm, may want
    for neither amusement nor a convenient place to purchase
    the hundred and one articles that his better
    seven-eighths has cautioned him not to come home
    without.</p>

    <p>Singularly enough, the same methods obtain in
    bargaining for cows in Utrecht that are prevalent
    while dickering for cheeses in Alkmaar. There is
    the same placid composure on the part of the seller,
    the same minute examination on the part of the buyer;
    there is the same Captain John Smith pose; there is
    the same whacking of hands; there is the same general
    exodus from the market place, after the ceremonies,
    to the more blithesome lunchrooms and halls
    of frivolity. I wish I might have followed up the
    case of a cattle dealer whom I saw in a certain café
    after the market, making a lunch of the uncertain
    mixture of a glass of beer and a dish of currants.
    The notation of the after effects of the combination
    might have been of value to materia medica.</p>

    <p>Utrecht’s famous old churches have been pillaged
    and desecrated to a great extent by the elements and
    the changes wrought by time and tide. Once, long
    ago, when the followers of the various creeds were
    all at sixes and sevens, the Munsterkerk, the Pieterskerk,
    the Janskerk, and the cathedral itself, no doubt,
    with their cloistersful of clergy, were walled in and
    moated, and patronized as much as asylums of refuge
    as for worship. To-day they are simply tolerated.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>A coffeehouse does a land office business in the archbishop’s
    palace, and the tramcar company has tunneled
    through the vaulted archway of the great detached
    cathedral tower rather than go to the trouble
    of laying the tracks around it.</p>

    <p>And what a cathedral this Gothic curiosity of
    Utrecht is! Erected in the eleventh century upon the
    site of a former ecclesiastical edifice founded in 720,
    in its day it must have easily outclassed anything of
    its ilk in all the Netherlands. Now its back is
    broken, so to speak, beyond repair, for in 1674 a
    violent hurricane that bowled a spare with the church
    towers in the district, tore out the nave of the
    cathedral and left the tower and the choir completely
    disconnected. The site of the demolished
    nave now forms the center of the Cathedral Square,
    and is as much a thoroughfare as any street in the
    city.</p>

    <p>The interior of the church, like the interior of almost
    every church of any size in Holland, offers little
    of originality or interest. The walls are covered
    with many layers of unbecoming whitewash, and any
    pleasing effect that the columned interior might have
    originally had is lost, for a portion in the center is
    boarded up, like a bull ring with its barrier, segregating
    the inclosed space for the purpose of uninterrupted
    worship. The one redeeming feature of the
    whole place, aside from a few meritorious monuments,
    is a handsome oaken pulpit, elaborately carved by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>hand, so as to give the effect of a miniature cathedral
    in itself.</p>

    <p>After being a city of disabled and decrepit
    churches, Utrecht is a university town, and the seven
    or eight hundred students in attendance do their best
    to emulate the early ecclesiastics by trying to keep
    the place in a state of perennial siege, for it is to be
    remembered that the drudgery and frugality of university
    life in Holland is not what it is cracked up to
    be. In a way, a Dutch college education is a good
    bit of a farce. The student is under very few
    obligations except to himself. He does not have to
    appear in chapel; he does not even have to attend
    classes, and there are a large number of students in
    each of Holland’s three universities&mdash;young men of
    private fortune who take up a course in law or what
    not, with no intention of ever practicing, in order to
    avail themselves of the gaiety and freedom of university
    life&mdash;who never enter a lecture room from one
    term’s end to the other. Consequently, there is much
    hilarity and much extravagance, all of which is more
    or less resented by the thrifty, peaceful townspeople,
    and which sometimes places the two factions under
    strained relations. When a student does complete a
    course, having seen fit to relegate himself to the hard,
    honest work necessary to the attainment of a doctor’s
    degree, he deems it of such momentous occurrence
    that he forthwith has his thesis published in
    book form <i>de luxe</i>, and, hiring a carriage, which is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>manned by student initiates into his Corps, he drives
    in state to the residences of his several professors and
    intimate friends, leaving with each a copy of his
    work.</p>

    <p>In the above mentioning of the Students’ Corps, I
    have named a salient feature of student life in Holland,
    and one which none of her universities is without.
    Although of broader membership, it takes the
    place of our own fraternities. It includes, however,
    all the students who can afford to pay its dues and
    subscriptions. A senate, comprising a rector, a secretary,
    and three other functionaries, elected annually
    by the Corps from among its members of four or
    more years’ standing, dictates the policy of the Corps
    and administers its affairs. Any member of the
    Corps is eligible for membership in the Corps Club,
    the culminating distinction of Dutch university life,
    or for any of its various subdivisions of athletic or
    social societies. The initiates undergo most of the
    harmless little byplays, not to mention some new
    ones, that provide for such a halcyon period in the
    careers of our own fraternal neophytes.</p>

    <p>Among its numerous idiosyncrasies Utrecht has a
    canal, called the Oude Gracht, that is unique in
    comparison with other canals in other cities in Holland.
    The water in this canal lies far below the
    level of the bordering streets. Between the street
    and the water there is a great stone step that forms
    the real canal bank. In the old days the “riser”
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>above this step was made up of foundation arches of
    stone upon which were built the specious mansions
    that fronted the thoroughfares alongside the canal.
    To make use of spaces which would otherwise be
    wasted, these vaulted foundations served as cellars,
    with the street for a roof, and were in as constant
    use as any other part of the dwelling. Most of
    them are now occupied as shops, to the entrances
    of which you must descend a flight of steps from
    the roadway above; but here and there their windows
    display the lace curtain and the boxful of
    flowers that give evidence of domestic habitation.</p>

    <p>Utrecht, too, has many verdant beauty spots, the
    most verdant being the Hoogeland Park, with its circumference
    bordered with attractive villas and reached
    through a wide lime avenue they call the Maliebaan.
    In the Antiquarian Museum, situated in the park, one
    may behold the two most interesting relics in the possession
    of Utrecht, if we exclude, perhaps, the seventy
    different kinds of lace on view in the Archiepiscopal
    Museum on the Nieuwe Gracht. These are: a
    table, handsomely and delicately carved, at which the
    signatories of the famous Peace of Utrecht were
    said to have sat in 1713; and the “Doll’s House,” an
    accurate reproduction in miniature of a patrician
    dwelling of the period, executed in 1680, and worked
    out in the minutest detail from cellar to chimney pot,
    from kitchen utensils to genuine oil paintings by celebrated
    masters on the walls of the drawing room.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>
    <p>Surrounding Utrecht and penetrating far to the
    east and the south are the great fortifications,
    of whose presence the casual observer is entirely
    unaware, belonging to the first line of national
    defense that might be used to protect the Dutch
    capital from invasion&mdash;a defense in which she
    seeks the assistance of her mortal enemy, and discovers
    him weighed in the balance and not found
    wanting. Upon a process of general inundation, by
    fresh water wherever possible so as not to impair the
    future productiveness of the fields, does Holland depend
    for her safety from invasion both by land
    and by sea. In the probability of the latter, her
    power of self-exclusion is augmented by a treaty with
    Belgium, signed in 1892, confirmed in 1905, and only
    recently made public, reserving for her the right
    to block the great estuary of the Scheldt in case of
    war or rumors of war. In times of peace Belgium
    shares with the Netherlands all rights of navigation
    of the Scheldt, and Holland may not displace or
    remove buoys, lights, or other aids to navigation,
    without Belgian consent.</p>

    <p class="center">The lower end of the Oude Gracht, Utrecht, a canal which
    in its upper part is at a level far below the street, giving space
    between the foundation walls for shops and even homes</p>
    </div>

    <p>But with regard to Holland’s ability to isolate herself
    by general inundation, it is a scheme that gives
    little outward evidence of being in operation. A
    stranger might roam within her boundaries for a
    year and a day without even surmising that such a
    thing could be accomplished, so successfully are her
    greatest works hidden from the eye. The scheme
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>provides, in brief, for the blowing up of railway
    bridges and for the opening of the sluice gates of
    great reservoirs, regulating the amount of water to
    be poured in over the country so that it should all
    be of the same depth, prohibiting both the possibility
    of wading through it and the passage of vessels
    over it.</p>

    <p>A half a day, if time presses, will suffice to see Bois
    le Duc. After you have wandered about in its great
    Gothic cathedral of St. John, one of the largest and,
    by all odds, the fanciest church&mdash;if a church can be
    said to be fancy&mdash;in Holland, you will have done with
    the town. It holds nothing else of interest. Although
    of 32,000 population, and the capital of the
    Province of North Brabant, it is dull and unappealing
    to the tourist. There are few types and few distinctive
    mannerisms. Of its costumes, the only
    feature is a headdress, affected by some of the countrywomen
    of the surrounding district, composed of
    white lace and topped with garlands of artificial
    flowers as ridiculous and disappointing as the “poke
    bonnets” worn by the middle-aged matrons of Leeuwarden,
    and just as out of place.</p>

    <p>Even the market square is devoid of the usual
    fringe of ancient buildings. Here they hold a cattle
    market on Wednesdays, but to strike every city
    in Holland upon the day of its distinctive market
    would necessitate a vast amount of vibratory traveling,
    which in itself, and not considering the markets,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>would soon grow monotonous. I happened upon Bois
    le Duc on a Saturday, when one of those nondescript,
    unsavory bazaars of cooking utensils and crockery
    was in full swing. It was a hot day, for Holland,
    and the sun beat down upon the unprotected square
    with a most uncomfortable effect. So I spent most
    of my spare time under the awning of a nearby café
    watching the business transactions of a couple of
    “hokey-pokey” wagons, decorated and garnished so
    that they resembled the floats in a Queen of the May
    pageant.</p>

    <p>But an inspection of Bois le Duc’s cathedral will
    reimburse any traveler who has planned to pay the
    town a visit. It stands on the edge of a wide parade
    ground, not far from the market, from the opposite
    side of which the church’s Gothic gargoyles and entablatures
    can be seen to good advantage above the
    trees.</p>

    <p>Founded in the eleventh century, this cathedral was
    originally erected as a Romanesque edifice. After
    suffering the inevitable results of a devastating conflagration,
    it was rebuilt in the early half of the fifteenth
    century, its Romanesque design having been
    discarded and a late Gothic one adopted. Since 1860
    it has been subjected to a plan of restoration. And
    not only from without is it a pleasing contrast to
    the usual run of Dutch churches, but it is the only
    one in Holland whose interior, having marvelously
    escaped the iconoclasm of early days, and having
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>been allowed to remain undesecrated by the customary
    coat of whitewash and the central bull ring, is what
    it ought to be. The visitor of to-day may obtain
    an uninterrupted view from one end of the cathedral
    to the other, for the authorities, always in need of
    funds to carry on the restorations to the church, sold
    its handsome choir screen some years ago and realized
    $4,500 on it. But the absence of the screen will
    scarcely be noticed in the cathedral&mdash;indeed, the general
    effect is more satisfying without it. Stowed
    away, however, among a collection of other ecclesiastical
    curios in the new Victoria and Albert Museum
    in South Kensington, London, without the
    lights and shadows of its church to enhance its richness,
    it has lost much of its beauty.</p>

    <p>From Bois le Duc I was ticketed to quit the country.
    I had seen the cathedral, and time hung heavily,
    so I wandered back to the station all of an hour
    before the scheduled departure of my train, to jot
    down a few notes and indulge in a few final musings
    upon a great nation&mdash;the only little thing about which
    I found to be its area&mdash;a nation of great deeds in
    peace and in war, a nation of great men, a nation
    that has, by the sheer character of its people, surmounted
    great obstacles, and a nation with a future
    as great as its past.</p>

    <p>Each time I have visited Holland I have been loath
    to leave, but in more ways than one this feeling was
    mitigated in Bois le Duc, for Bois le Duc is a more
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>satisfactory place to leave from than The Hague,
    for example, and when the always solicitous station
    master, in black frock coat and bright red cap,
    finally came to tell me that my train was due, I gathered
    together my impedimenta and followed him resignedly
    toward the train shed.</p>

    <p>As I passed through the waiting-room my eye
    caught some lettering over the mantel of an artistic
    fireplace. Its words pronounced the traveler’s benediction:
    “<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Goede Reis</i>.” Whether he appreciated the
    fact or not, that old fireplace had stood there for
    years, wishing the voyageur a pleasant journey, and
    the gentleness, the simple kindliness of the message
    struck me as being characteristic of the men who put
    it there&mdash;the Hollanders.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
